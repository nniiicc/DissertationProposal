#A Framework for Analyzing the Sustainability of Peer Produced Science Commons

####Abstract 

The sustainability of eScience research infrastructures is an increasingly complex problem addressed by science and technology policy. Through a case study of the International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS) I describe a process of sharing and pooling resources across traditional organizational boundaries, and the collective action needed to sustain this cooperative arrangement in the face of political, social and economic change. I use this work to support the testing and refinement of an analytical framework. The contribution of this work will be a better understanding of how institutions for collective action evolve, and a framework for reducing the complexity of studying eScience commons.
