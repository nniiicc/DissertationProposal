#A Framework for Analyzing the Sustainability of Peer Produced Science Commons

####Abstract 

The sustainability of eScience research infrastructures is an increasingly complex problem addressed by science and technology policy. Through a case study of the International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS) I describe the peer productiong of for sharing and pooling resources across traditional organizational boundaries and the collective action needed to sustain this cooperative arrangement in the face of political, social and economic change. I use this work to support the testing and refinement of an analytical framework. The contribution of this work will be a better understanding of how institutions for collective action evolve, and a framework for reducing the complexity of studying eScience commons.


A copy of the dissertation proposal is available in [pdf](http://bit.ly/1l1i7U5) or [html]().

This repository contains the software, data, images, and documents I used to generate this proposal- and the slides I'll use for the oral defense.

Files contain the following content:

+ **Study 1** Contains data and scripts from producing the Data Usage Index describe in Chapter 1. 
+ **Study 2** Contains data, code and images for producing the Phylogenetic trees in the Genealogy study described in Chapter 1.
+ **ProposalDocument** contains the LaTex template and the images used to produce the actual proposal
+ **Study Protocol** has drafts of the protocol I developed to conduct the case study (Final draft to be uploaded very soon)
+ **SupportingBibliometricsData** contains network data, text files from ISI, and some preliminary images. This work is referred to in a few different places in the proposal, but described at length. 

If you spot an error (and there are many to find) in any of this material please consider filing an [issue](https://github.com/nniiicc/DissertationProposal/issues) to let me know.
