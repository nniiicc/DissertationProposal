#A Framework for Analyzing the Sustainability of Peer Produced Science Commons

####Abstract 

The sustainability of eScience research infrastructures is an increasingly complex problem addressed by science and technology policy. Through a case study of the International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Dataset
(ICOADS) I describe a common property regime for sharing and pooling resources across traditional organizational boundaries, and the collective action needed to sustain this arrangement in the face of political, social, and
economic change. I use this work to support the testing and refinement of
an analytical framework. The contribution of this work will be a better understanding of how institutions for collective action evolve, and a framework for reducing the complexity of studying eScience commons


A copy of the dissertation proposal is available in [pdf](http://bit.ly/1uMHkln) or [html]().


This repository contains the software, data, images, and documents I used to generate this proposal- and the slides I'll use for the oral defense.


Files contain the following content:

+ **Study 1** Contains data and scripts from producing the Data Usage Index describe in Chapter 1. 
+ **Study 2** Contains data, code and images for producing the Phylogenetic trees in the Genealogy study described in Chapter 1. This is mostly the work and insight of Andrea Thomer  [(@an_dre_a_)](https://twitter.com/an_dre_a_)
+ **ProposalDocument** contains the LaTex template and the images used to produce the actual proposal
+ **Study Protocol** has drafts of the protocol I developed to conduct the case study (Final draft to be uploaded very soon)
+ **SupportingBibliometricsData** contains network data, text files from ISI, and some preliminary images. This work is referred to in a few different places in the proposal, but not described at length. 


*If you spot an error (and there will be many) please consider filing an [issue](https://github.com/nniiicc/DissertationProposal/issues) to let me know.
