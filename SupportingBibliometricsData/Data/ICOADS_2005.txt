AB Data collected from ships and satellites has frequently been used to
   estimate trends in surface wind speed. Although these data sets
   consistently show an increase in global average wind speed over recent
   decades, the magnitude of this increase varies depending on the data
   source used. Observations of the ocean surface by satellites, namely
   altimeter and SSM/I, provide reasonably long datasets with global
   coverage. These well calibrated and validated datasets are analysed for
   linear trends of regional mean monthly time series and mean time series
   for each calendar month over the period from 1991 to 2008. Differences
   between the resulting trends are investigated and discussed. The data
   indicate that the observed global trend is not uniformly distributed and
   can be linked to a significant positive trend in regional average time
   series across equatorial regions and the Southern Ocean. When trends for
   each calendar month are considered, the Southern Ocean showed a
   consistent increase for at least three continuous months. Although
   altimeter trends are consistently stronger than trends from SSM/I, the
   two datasets share similarities. For example, for some regions the
   trends are up to 2.0 times the global average trend. The data also show
   that the month of May exhibits one of largest positive trends and this
   was found across the North Indian Ocean which may indicate a shift in
   the onset time of the monsoon season. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB A worldwide climatology of the diurnal cycles of low clouds is obtained
   from surface observations made eight or four times daily at 3- or 6-h
   intervals from weather stations and ships. Harmonic fits to the daily
   cycle are made for 5388 weather stations with long periods of record,
   and for gridded data on a 5 degrees x 5 degrees or 10 degrees x 10
   degrees latitude-longitude grid over land and ocean areas separately.
   For all cloud types, the diurnal cycle has larger amplitude over land
   than over ocean, on average by a factor of 2. Diurnal cycles of cloud
   amount appear to be proprietary to each low cloud type, showing the same
   cycle regardless of whether that type dominates the diurnal cycle of
   cloud cover. Stratiform cloud amounts tend to peak near sunrise, while
   cumuliform amounts peak in the afternoon; however, cumulonimbus amounts
   peak in the early morning over the ocean. Small latitudinal and seasonal
   variation is apparent in the phase and amplitude of the diurnal cycles
   of each type. Land areas show more seasonality compared to ocean areas
   with respect to which type dominates the diurnal cycle.
   Multidecadal trends in low cloud cover are small and agree between day
   and night regardless of the local climate.
   Diurnal cycles of base height are much larger over land than over the
   ocean. For most cloud types, the bases are highest in the midafternoon
   or early evening.

AB The accurate estimation of near-surface marine-specific humidity is
   necessary for climate and air-sea interaction applications. Available
   estimates of monthly mean-specific humidity spanning the past 50-years
   are based on a variety of sources including in situ observations,
   atmospheric reanalyses and datasets that blend many different data
   sources. Eight specific humidity datasets are compared and little
   consensus emerges as to mean values, regional variations and changes
   over time. For large area averages the datasets do show consistency in
   their interannual variations and, in the Extratropics, in their seasonal
   cycles. Adjustments applied to in situ observations from ships are shown
   to be smaller than differences among the datasets and in well-sampled
   regions and periods the in situ data are able to highlight biases in the
   reanalysis-based specific humidity estimates. Near surface-specific
   humidity estimates from two recent atmospheric reanalysis projects show
   markedly different responses in Tropical-specific humidity to the
   assimilation of satellite radiance measurements that became available in
   1999. There is less confidence in reanalysis-based estimates of specific
   humidity over the ocean than over land. However the in situ-based
   humidity analyses have suffered in recent years with a reduction in
   observation numbers and lack of information on observation methods and
   heights. Consequently near-surface-specific humidity remains relatively
   poorly known over the oceans.

AB The quality of in situ sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is critical for
   calibration and validation of satellite SSTs. In situ SSTs come from
   different countries, agencies, and platforms. As a result, their quality
   is often suboptimal, nonuniform, and measurement-type specific. This
   paper describes a system developed at the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the in situ SST Quality Monitor
   (iQuam; www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/sod/sst/iquam/). It performs three
   major functions with the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) data: 1)
   quality controls (QC) in situ SSTs, using Bayesian reference and buddy
   checks similar to those adopted in the Met Office, in addition to
   providing basic screenings, such as duplicate removal, plausibility,
   platform track, and SST spike checks; 2) monitors quality-controlled
   SSTs online, in near-real time; and 3) serves reformatted GTS SST data
   to NOAA and external users with quality flags appended. Currently,
   iQuam's web page displays global monthly maps of measurement locations
   stratified by four in situ platform types (drifters, ships, and tropical
   and coastal moorings) as well as their corresponding in situ minus
   reference SST statistics. Time series of all corresponding SST and QC
   statistics are also trended. The web page user can also monitor
   individual in situ platforms. The current status of iQuam and ongoing
   improvements are discussed.

AB An important task of the departmental research programme KLIWAS is the
   evaluation and assessment of climate model results by means of a
   comprehensive reference data set. For validation purposes, and to create
   a North Sea wide maritime atmospheric and oceanographic reference
   database, in-situ observations of the Centre for Global Marine
   Meteorological Observations (GZS) of the National Meteorological Service
   DWD have been compared to the ERA-40 reanalysis. ERA-40 is used as
   forcing for the hindcast runs of the ENSEMBLES regional climate models,
   which is used within the KLIWAS model chain. The GZS hosts a regularly
   updated, quality controlled, world-wide data bank of weather
   observations from the oceans. It includes data from all sorts of
   observation platforms as Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS), drifting and
   moored buoys, light vessels, and offshore platforms, either from
   real-time (RT) via the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) or from
   international exchange in delayed-mode (DM). In addition to the
   automated set of programs applied for high quality control, erroneous
   data are also manually corrected to a certain extent, if possible. To
   assure reliable statistics for the evaluation, the corrected
   observations are gridded to a resolution of 2.25 degree, so each grid
   box includes four ERA-40 reanalysis grid points. The temporal coverage
   of the grid boxes depends on shipping routes and the positions of
   automated systems. Observed air temperatures, covering a period of 40
   years (1961-2000), show noticeable differences to the reanalysis data
   for all land influenced boxes, specifically in the winter months. The
   same differences can be found if ERA-40 data alone are compared between
   land-and sea facing boxes. They can not be found in GZS data. It can be
   assumed that the differences are not resulting from measurement errors
   or uncertain fraction variabilities, since they are small during the
   winter months. A comparison of the differences basing on the 1981-2000
   period to those of the 1961-1980 period shows an increase. Further
   investigations reveal that differences are largest in the landward part
   of the grid boxes, whereas in the parts facing to the open sea,
   observations and ERA-40 are in fair agreement. This leads to the
   conclusion, that the resolution of the ERA-40 reanalysis is not
   sufficient for detailed analyses of air temperatures near the coasts.
   However, this problem does not occur for the sea level pressure. The
   described land influence does not interfere with parameters, that are
   more or less insensitive to the land-sea distribution.

AB During June-November 2012, pronounced differences in tropical Pacific
   sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies were observed between three
   widely used SST products: the extended reconstructed SST version 3b
   (ERSSTv3b), and the optimum interpolation SST version 2 analyses
   (OISST), produced weekly (OISSTwk) and daily (OISSTdy). During
   June-August 2012, the Nino-3.4 SST anomaly (SSTA) index was 0.2
   degrees-0.3 degrees C lower in ERSSTv3b than in OISSTwk and OISSTdy,
   while it was 0.3 degrees-0.4 degrees C higher from September to November
   2012. Such differences in the Nino-3.4 SSTA index can impact the
   assessment of the status of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, which is
   determined using a threshold of 0.5 degrees C in the Nino-3.4 SSTA
   index.To investigate the reasons for the differences between ERSSTv3b
   and OISSTdy/OISSTwk, an experimental analysis (called ERSSTsat) is
   created that is similar to ERSSTv3b but includes satellite-derived SSTs.
   However, significant differences in the Nino-3.4 SSTA index remained
   between ERSSTsat and OISSTdy/OISSTwk. Comparisons of ERSSTsat and
   OISSTdy indicate that their differences are mostly associated with the
   different schemes for bias adjustment applied to the satellite-based
   SSTs. It is therefore suggested that the differences in the Nino-3.4
   SSTA index between ERSSTv3b and OISSTdy cannot be solely due to the
   inclusion of but by the bias adjustment methodology of satellite data in
   OISSTdy.Finally, the SST products are compared with observations from
   ships, buoys, and satellites. On the monthly time scale, the
   area-averaged Nino-3.4 SSTA index in the tropical Pacific is more
   consistent with in situ observations in ERSSTv3b than in OISSTdy. In
   contrast, pointwise observations across the tropical Pacific are more
   consistent with OISSTdy than ERSSTv3b. It is therefore suggested that
   the differences among SST products are partially due to a structural
   uncertainty of various SST estimates.

AB In this work, we analysed the latitudinal trends in the nursery habitat
   colonization processes of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus).
   This was accomplished by estimating the duration of the pelagic and
   metamorphic stages, as well as the duration of the spawning period, in
   several nursery areas across its geographical distribution range in the
   European Atlantic Coast: Mondego estuary (Portugal), Vilaine estuary
   (France), Slack estuary (France), Wadden Sea (Netherlands) and the
   Sorfjord (Norway). All juvenile flounders were captured with beam trawls
   in June/July 2010, and otolith microstructure was used to determine the
   duration of each stage by means of daily growth increments. The pelagic
   and metamorphic stages were longer at the middle of the distribution
   range, and lasted in total up to two months after hatching. The spawning
   period occurred between mid-January and early-July over the species'
   distribution range, with a time lapse of nearly two months between the
   Mondego estuary and the Sorfjord, as a consequence of warmer water
   temperature earlier in the season in southern areas. In general, total
   length of the captured fish showed a latitudinal dine between the
   northernmost and southernmost sampling sites, with higher values at the
   middle of the distribution range. The results also suggested the
   existence of a countergradient growth compensation mechanism in the
   northernmost populations. Apart from temperature, which sets the general
   metabolic pace of organisms, differences between sites were also related
   with local features, such as the extension of the continental platform
   and adaptations to transport and retention mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB Most global climate models (GCMs) suffer from biases of a reversed zonal
   gradient in sea surface temperature (SST) and weak surface easterlies
   (the westerly bias) in the equatorial Atlantic during boreal spring.
   These biases exist in atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) and are amplified by
   air-sea interactions in atmospheric-oceanic GCMs. This problem has
   persisted despite considerable model improvements in other aspects. This
   study proposes a hypothesis that there are two possible root causes for
   the westerly bias. The first is insufficient lower-tropospheric diabatic
   heating over Amazonia. The second is erroneously weak zonal momentum
   flux (entrainment) across the top of the boundary layer. This hypothesis
   is based on a scale analysis of a simple model for a well-mixed
   equatorial boundary layer and diagnoses of simulations from eight AGCMs.
   Severe westerly biases in AGCMs tend to occur when the diabatic heating
   at low levels (850-700 hPa) over Amazonia is too weak. Deficient
   low-level diabatic heating weakens the zonal gradient in sea level
   pressure along the Atlantic equator, introducing westerly biases. In
   addition, westerly biases may also occur when easterly momentum flux due
   to entrainment is underestimated.

AB The accurate estimation of marine wind speed is important for climate
   and air-sea interaction applications. There are many datasets of monthly
   mean wind speeds available based either on in situ measurements,
   satellite retrievals, atmospheric reanalysis assimilating both in situ
   and satellite data and blended datasets combining some or all of these
   other data sources. Twelve different monthly mean wind speed datasets
   are compared for the period from 1987 to 2009. The results suggest that
   we cannot presently be confident that the mean wind speed over the ocean
   is known to the accuracy required for the calculation of air-sea heat
   fluxes. Comparisons are complicated by different representations of wind
   speed being presented in different datasets. The in situ and reanalysis
   datasets present stability-dependent, earth-relative, wind speeds
   adjusted to a reference level of 10m. The satellite and blended datasets
   present neutral equivalent, surface-relative, speeds adjusted to a
   reference level of 10m. Differences between these estimates depend on
   atmospheric stability and ocean currents and can be greater than the
   required accuracy target. The adjustment for stability is itself
   uncertain but it is shown that these uncertainties are likely to be
   smaller than biases caused when the effects of stability are neglected.
   Further differences among the datasets are identified. Biases are caused
   by unidentified rain in K-u-band scatterometer-derived wind speeds and
   by atmospheric effects on passive microwave wind retrievals. When
   satellite observations affected by rain are removed a fair-weather bias
   remains. Some datasets are biased low in coastal regions by the effects
   of lower wind speeds over land in atmospheric models affecting wind
   speeds near the coast. All these uncertainties combine to give a wide
   range of estimates of monthly mean wind speed for the chosen datasets
   with uncertainty in mean values, spatial patterns and changes over time.

AB It is now well known that there is a strong association of the extremes
   of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) with the El Nio and
   southern oscillation (ENSO) and the Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation
   (EQUINOO), later being an east-west oscillation in convection anomaly
   over the equatorial Indian Ocean. So far, the index used for EQUINOO is
   EQWIN, which is based on the surface zonal wind over the central
   equatorial Indian Ocean. Since the most important attribute of EQUINOO
   is the oscillation in convection/precipitation, we believe that the
   indices based on convection or precipitation would be more appropriate.
   Continuous and reliable data on outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and
   satellite derived precipitation are now available from 1979 onwards.
   Hence, in this paper, we introduce new indices for EQUINOO, based on the
   difference in the anomaly of OLR/precipitation between eastern and
   western parts of the equatorial Indian Ocean. We show that the strong
   association of extremes of the Indian summer monsoon with ENSO and
   EQUINOO is also seen when the new indices are used to represent EQUINOO.

   on a platform-by-platform basis to high-quality SST estimates from the

   reveals drifter observations are generally of good quality but
   frequently suffer from gross errors, whilst ship observations are
   generally of worse quality and show a diverse range of measurement
   errors. QC procedures are developed which similarly assess drifter and
   ship SST observations through comparison with the Met Office Operational
   SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA). These procedures make use of seasonal
   background error variance estimates now available for OSTIA. Drifter
   observations displaying some commonly observed gross errors are flagged
   and ship callsigns whose observations are deemed unreliable are

   demonstrates that this retrospective QC improves the quality of drifter
   and ship observations, though some limitations are discussed.

AB In this article, the results of an investigation into the atmospheric
   pressure conditions in the Arctic in the period from 1801 to 1920 are
   presented. For this period, which can be described as early
   instrumental', limited meteorological data exist from a network of
   regular stations. As a result, in order to get at least a rough idea of
   pressure conditions in the Arctic in the study period, data from
   different land and marine expeditions were collected. A total of 94
   pressure series of monthly means have been gathered, the duration of
   which is usually less than 2 years. While the area and time periods
   covered by the data are variable, it is still possible to describe the
   general character of the pressure conditions. The results show that the
   areally averaged Arctic pressure in the early instrumental period
   (1861-1920) was 0.8 hPa lower than today (1961-1990). Lower values of
   atmospheric pressure were also observed in all study regions, excluding
   the Atlantic. The greatest negative differences (-2.1 hPa) have been
   found for the Canadian Arctic. The greatest changes between the
   historical and present times were noted in all winter months and in
   winter as a whole (-1.9 hPa), while in summer and autumn they were very
   small and their average differences came to - 0.1 and - 0.2 hPa,
   respectively. Comparison of historical and contemporary annual courses
   of atmospheric pressure in the whole of the Arctic and in its particular
   regions reveals general consonance. There is evidence to show that
   changes in Arctic atmospheric pressure during the whole study period
   were insignificant. Atmospheric pressure in the first International
   Polar Year (IPY) period (September 1882 to July 1883) was, on average,
   1.4 hPa higher than in modern period (1961-1990). The greatest positive
   seasonal differences between historical and contemporary pressure values
   occurred in autumn (2.6 hPa), while the lowest were in winter (only 0.2
   hPa). Spatial patterns of average annual and seasonal atmospheric
   pressure in the Arctic were very similar to present day ones. The
   pressure differences calculated between historical and modern mean
   monthly values show that almost all of them lie within one standard
   deviation from present long-term mean (1961-1990). Thus, this means that
   the atmospheric pressure in the early instrumental period was not
   significantly different to that of the present day. Recent, commonly
   used gridded datasets of the sea level atmospheric pressure (HadSLP2 and
   the 20th Century Reanalysis Project) reveal quite a large positive bias
   in the period 1850-1920 in comparison to the real data from the
   instrumental observations. Copyright (c) 2012 Royal Meteorological

AB We developed a broadly applicable method for estimating stock-specific
   spatial distributions based on patterns in contacts per unit effort
   determined from data collected in ocean fisheries. The method fully
   accounts for fishing effort and quantifies uncertainty in total contacts
   due to sampling error and the effects of annual variability in
   size-at-age on estimated contacts with sublegal-sized fish. As a case
   study, we used coded-wire tag recoveries to compare ocean spatial
   distributions among fish from four return run timings (fall, late-fall,
   winter, and spring) of Chinook salmon from the Central Valley,
   California, USA, and explored how distributions varied annually,
   seasonally, and with fish age in the data-rich fall run. All runs were
   rarely contacted in ocean fisheries north of Cape Falcon, Oregon (45
   degrees 46'N). Late-fall and winter run fish appeared relatively
   restricted to the south compared with fall run fish, corresponding to
   life history differences and highlighting the ability of spatial
   management to control impacts on the endangered winter run. For the fall
   run, the location of highest relative contacts per unit effort of age-3
   fish varied across years. This variation correlated with sea surface
   temperature the previous summer, suggesting ocean distributions may be
   more responsive to the environment than previously appreciated.

AB Constraining the low-frequency (LF) behavior of general circulation
   models (GCMs) requires reliable observational estimates of LF
   variability. This two-part paper presents multiproxy reconstructions of
   Nino-3.4 sea surface temperature over the last millennium, applying two
   techniques [ composite plus scale (CPS) and hybrid regularized
   expectation maximization (RegEM) truncated total least squares (TTLS)]
   to a network of tropical, high-resolution proxy records. This first part
   presents the data and methodology before evaluating their predictive
   skill using frozen network analysis (FNA) and pseudoproxy experiments.
   The FNA results suggest that about half of the Nino-3.4 variance can be
   reconstructed back to A. D. 1000, but they show little LF skill during
   certain intervals. More variance can be reconstructed in the interannual
   band where climate signals are strongest, but this band is affected by
   dating uncertainties (which are not formally addressed here). The CPS
   reliably estimates interannual variability, while LF fluctuations are
   more faithfully reconstructed with RegEM, albeit with inevitable
   variance loss. The RegEM approach is also tested on representative
   pseudoproxy networks derived from two millennium-long integrations of a
   coupled GCM. The pseudoproxy study confirms that reconstruction skill is
   significant in both the interannual and LF bands, provided that
   sufficient variance is exhibited in the target Nino-3.4 index. It also
   suggests that FNA severely underestimates LF skill, even when LF
   variability is strong, resulting in overly pessimistic performance
   assessments. The centennial-scale variance of the historical Nino-3.4
   index falls somewhere between the two model simulations, suggesting that
   the network and methodology presented here would be able to capture the
   leading LF variations in Nino-3.4 for much of the past millennium, with
   the caveats noted above.

AB The Walker circulation is one of the major components of the large-scale
   tropical atmospheric circulation and variations in its strength are
   critical to equatorial Pacific Ocean circulation. It has been argued in
   the literature that during the 20th century the Walker circulation
   weakened, and that this weakening was attributable to anthropogenic
   climate change. By using updated observations, we show that there has
   been a rapid interdecadal enhancement of the Walker circulation since
   the late 1990s. Associated with this enhancement is enhanced
   precipitation in the tropical western Pacific, anomalous westerlies in
   the upper troposphere, descent in the central and eastern tropical
   Pacific, and anomalous surface easterlies in the western and central
   tropical Pacific. The characteristics of associated oceanic changes are
   a strengthened thermocline slope and an enhanced zonal SST gradient
   across the tropical Pacific. Many characteristics of these changes are
   similar to those associated with the mid-1970s climate shift with an
   opposite sign. We also show that the interdecadal variability of the
   Walker circulation in the tropical Pacific is inversely correlated to
   the interdecadal variability of the zonal circulation in the tropical
   Atlantic. An enhancement of the Walker circulation in the tropical
   Pacific is associated with a weakening zonal circulation in the tropical
   Atlantic and vise versa, implying an inter-Atlantic-Pacific connection
   of the zonal overturning circulation variation. Whether these recent
   changes will be sustained is not yet clear, but our research highlights
   the importance of understanding the interdecadal variability, as well as
   the long-term trends, that influence tropical circulation.

AB An updated version of the Met Office Hadley Centre's monthly night
   marine air temperature data set is presented. It is available on a 5
   degrees latitude-longitude grid from 1880 as anomalies relative to
   1961-1990 calendar-monthly climatological average night marine air
   temperature (NMAT). Adjustments are made for changes in observation
   height; these depend on estimates of the stability of the near surface
   atmospheric boundary layer. In previous versions of the data set, ad hoc
   adjustments were also made for three periods and regions where poor
   observational practice was prevalent. These adjustments are re-examined.
   Estimates of uncertainty are calculated for every grid box and result
   from measurement errors, uncertainty in adjustments applied to the
   observations, uncertainty in the measurement height, and under-sampling.
   The new data set is a clear improvement over previous versions in terms
   of coverage because of the recent digitization of historical
   observations from ships' logbooks. However, the periods prior to about
   1890 and around World War II remain particularly uncertain, and sampling
   is still sparse in some regions in other periods. A further improvement
   is the availability of uncertainty estimates for every grid box and
   every month. Previous versions required adjustments that were dependent
   on contemporary measurements of sea surface temperature (SST); to avoid
   these, the new data set starts in 1880 rather than 1856. Overall
   agreement with variations of SST is better for the updated data set than
   for previous versions, supporting existing estimates of global warming
   and increasing confidence in the global record of temperature
   variability and change.

AB Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) is a key component of the Earth
   Climate System and identification of its changes during the 20th Century
   is critical to the understanding of its variation characteristics and
   the corresponding climatic impacts. Previous researches have been
   inconclusive, with the results varying depending on the approach used to
   measure THC. The results for the two established approaches for
   measurement of the phenomenon (direct observation and indirect
   reconstruction) are contradictive (weakening and non-weakening), and
   their credibility needs improving. Based on the tight relationship
   between THC anomaly and "see-saw" intensities of Sea Surface Temperature
   (SST) and Surface Air Temperature (SAT), we first diagnose their
   quantitative relationship in the model experiments, which is
   corresponding to its two possible scenarios, and then reconstruct the
   changes of THC during the 20th Century respectively with multiple
   observed datasets of SST and SAT. Model results show that THC anomaly
   and SST/SAT "see-saw" intensities are well correlated in timescales
   longer than 10/40 years under scenarios of weakening/non-weakening
   respectively. Two kinds of reconstructions here are consistent with each
   other, and we propose that THC has undergone a 2-cycle oscillation with
   inter-decadal scale since the Industrial Revolution with a magnitude of
   about 1 Sv. The transformation times of decadal trend are around the
   mid-1910s, the 1940s, and the mid-1970s. This research further validates
   the main results of previous reconstructions, and points out that THC
   does not have a long-term weakening during the 20th Century.

AB A long-term warming pattern of global subsurface ocean was detected
   separately from other natural variations. Three dominant modes were
   extracted: a long-term warming mode, a mode related to the El
   Nio/Southern Oscillation, and a mode related to the Atlantic
   Multidecadal Oscillation. The long-term warming mode explained 78 % of
   the global mean temperature variance from the surface to a depth of 300
   m, and the other two modes could explain most of the residual variance.
   Subsurface warming associated with the long-term warming mode was strong
   in the subtropics. In contrast, there was a local minimum of warming in
   the northern hemisphere subarctic ocean, and warming was suppressed in
   subsurface waters south of the equator. Atmospheric changes associated
   with the long-term warming mode showed negative (positive) sea level
   pressure anomalies at high (middle) latitudes in both hemispheres, and
   an intensification and/or a poleward expansion of mid-latitude
   westerlies. Wind stress curl changes were negative in the subtropics and
   positive in the subarctic of the northern hemisphere; changes that were
   consistent with the strong warming in the subtropics and the local
   minimum of warming in the subarctic. Warming of Southern Ocean
   subsurface waters coincided with southward migration and intensification
   of westerly winds, whereas surface warming to the south of 50A degrees S
   was suppressed, probably by strengthened northward Ekman transport.
   Positive wind stress curl off the equator with weakening of the tropical
   easterly winds in the Pacific and Indian Oceans was consistent with the
   subsurface negative temperature anomaly there.

AB The combination of remotely sensed gappy Sea surface temperature (SST)
   images with the missing data filling DINEOF (data interpolating
   empirical orthogonal functions) technique, followed by a principal
   component analysis of the reconstructed data, has been used to identify
   the time evolution and the daily scale variability of the wintertime
   surface signal of the Iberian Poleward Current (IPC), or Navidad, during
   the 1981-2010 period. An exhaustive comparison with the existing
   bibliography, and the vertical temperature and salinity profiles related
   to its extremes over the Bay of Biscay area, show that the obtained time
   series accurately reflect the IPC-Navidad variability. Once a time
   series for the evolution of the SST signal of the current over the last
   decades is well established, this time series is used to propose a
   physical mechanism in relation to the variability of the IPC-Navidad,
   involving both atmospheric and oceanic variables. According to the
   proposed mechanism, an atmospheric circulation anomaly observed in both
   the 500 hPa and the surface levels generates atmospheric surface level
   pressure, wind-stress and heat-flux anomalies. In turn, those surface
   level atmospheric anomalies induce mutually coherent SST and sea level
   anomalies over the North Atlantic area, and locally, in the Bay of
   Biscay area. These anomalies, both locally over the Bay of Biscay area
   and over the North Atlantic, are in agreement with several mechanisms
   that have separately been related to the variability of the IPC-Navidad,
   i.e. the south-westerly winds, the joint effect of baroclinicity and
   relief (JEBAR) effect, the topographic beta effect and a weakened North
   Atlantic gyre.

AB Temperature is observed to have different trends at coastal and ocean
   locations along the western Iberian Peninsula from 1975 to 2006, which
   corresponds to the last warming period in the area under study. The
   analysis was carried out by means of the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation
   (SODA). Reanalysis data are available at monthly scale with a horizontal
   resolution of 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees and a vertical resolution of 40
   levels, which allows obtaining information beneath the sea surface. Only
   the first 21 vertical levels (from 5.0 m to 729.35 m) were considered
   here, since the most important changes in heat content observed for the
   world ocean during the last decades, correspond to the upper 700 m.
   Warming was observed to be considerably higher at ocean locations than
   at coastal ones. Ocean warming ranged from values on the order of 0.3
   degrees C dec(-1) near surface to less than 0.1 degrees C dec(-1) at 500
   m, while coastal warming showed values close to 0.2 degrees C dec(-1)
   near surface, decreasing rapidly below 0.1 degrees C dec(-1) for depths
   on the order of 50 m. The heat content anomaly for the upper 700 m,
   showed a sharp increase from coast (0.46 Wm(-2)) to ocean (1.59 Wm(-2)).
   The difference between coastal and ocean values was related to the
   presence of coastal upwelling, which partially inhibits the warming from
   surface of near shore water. Citation: Santos F, Gomez-Gesteira M,

AB This paper analyzes in detail the characteristics of surface humidity
   changes in China under the background of global warming in the recent 50
   years by using the observation data compiled by the National
   Meteorological Information Center of China. The results reveal that (1)
   with the increase of temperature, surface saturation specific humidity
   (q (s)) shows basically an exponential growth, according to the
   Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The nationwide average moistening rate in
   winter is obviously less than the annual average rate and the summer
   rate. There are some regional differences in q (s) trends in different
   regions of China. For example, q (s) in central and eastern parts of
   China exhibits a reducing trend in summer, consistent with the weakening
   trend of temperature in these areas; (2) except parts of South China and
   Jianghuai Region in eastern China, unanimously increasing trends of
   annual and winter specific humidity (q) are found in most of China,
   especially in western China. In summer, except parts of Northeast China,
   Northwest China, and some areas over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the
   decreasing and drying trends are significant in most of China, which is
   not consistent with the global mean situation; (3) the surface relative
   humidity (RH) in most of China shows a reducing trend. One of the major
   reasons for the reduction of RH is that the increasing rates of q are
   smaller than those of q (s). Nonetheless, upward trends of RH in central
   and eastern China mainly due to the cooling temperature and rising q in
   these regions are observed in summer, leading to more precipitation.
   From about 2003 or so, q (s) has remarkably increased while q has
   sharply decreased in most parts of China; therefore, RH has reduced to a
   great extent. This may be closely related to the persistent growth of
   drought areas in China in the recent 10 years.

AB Observations show that the Tsushima Warm Current (TSWC) varies
   considerably on a seasonal time scale, with strong northward transport
   into the Japan/East Sea (JES) in summer and weak transport in winter. It
   has been shown in the previous studies that the mean TSWC is forced
   primarily by wind stress over the open ocean, while the local wind
   stress is less important. Nevertheless, the forcing mechanisms for the
   seasonal variability of the TSWC remain to be examined. A
   three-dimensional ocean model is used to investigate the contributions
   from both local and the open-ocean forcing to the seasonal variability
   of TSWC. The observed seasonal cycle is simulated well in the model, and
   then three additional sensitivity runs were conducted to isolate the
   local and open-ocean forcing. It was shown that the open ocean forcing
   and the local wind stress both contribute to the seasonal cycle of the
   TSWC. The impact from the open ocean forcing is facilitated through the
   Kuroshio Current (KC) interaction with Honshu-Kyushu Islands. The KC
   transport is stronger in summer than in winter, thus a similar seasonal
   variability takes place in the TSWC through the mechanism discussed by
   Yang (2007). On the other hand, the local wind stress varies with the
   East Asian Monsoon, which results in that the southward wind in winter
   tends to reduce the TSWC transport while the northward wind in summer is
   favorable for a stronger transport. The model experiments showed that
   the contribution from the open ocean is considerably more important than
   the contribution from the local wind stress forcing. (C) 2012 Elsevier

AB A sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice reanalysis has been produced
   at the Met Office based on the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis
   (OSTIA) system. The OSTIA reanalysis produces daily, high-resolution,
   global foundation SST and sea ice concentration fields from 1 January
   1985 to 31 December 2007. The SST reanalysis uses reprocessed satellite
   and in situ observations that are assimilated using a multiscale
   optimal-interpolation-type scheme similar to that used in the
   near-real-time OSTIA system. Validation of the SST analysis using
   assimilated in situ observation-minus-background statistics shows that
   the accuracy of the analysis increases throughout the reanalysis period;
   the global root-mean-square difference is approximately 0.50 K by 2007.
   This approach to validation is supported in the recent period by results
   from comparisons with independent near-surface Argo data against which a
   global standard deviation error of 0.55 K was calculated. Assessment of
   the OSTIA reanalysis at high latitudes demonstrates that the SST and sea
   ice fields are more consistent with one another in the Southern
   Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere. Comparison of the sea ice
   extents to those in a similar reanalysis shows OSTIA to have larger
   extents in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Southern Hemisphere extents
   are similar. The OSTIA reanalysis SSTs are shown to be regionally
   comparable with similar reanalyses, with the largest differences
   occurring at high latitudes in the summer hemisphere. Differences are
   observed around the ice edge and in regions with high SST gradients. The
   OSTIA reanalysis provides a valuable high-resolution addition to the
   satellite period SST data record that makes use of the (Advanced)
   Along-Track Scanning Radiometer [(A)ATSR] multimission data.

AB The regional ocean circulation within the Canary Upwelling System
   between 31 degrees N and 35 degrees N is studied using numerical tools.
   Seasonal mean and near-instantaneous velocity fields from a
   previously-generated climatological Regional Ocean Modelling System
   (ROMS) solution of the Canary Basin are used to force a series of
   offline Lagrangian particle-tracking experiments. The primary objective
   is to identify the pathways through which water parcels arrive at the
   upwelling region north of Cape Ghir. Examining year-long pathways, the
   Azores Current contributes over 80% of particles annually, of which a
   large proportion arrive directly from offshore (from the northwest),
   while others travel along the shelf and slope from the Gulf of Cadiz.
   The remaining similar to 20% originate within the Gulf of Cadiz or come
   from the south, although the southern contribution is only significant
   in autumn and winter. When season-long pathways are considered, the
   alongshore contributions become increasingly important: northern
   contributions reach 40% in spring and summer, while southern values
   exceed 35% in winter. This study also shows that coastal upwelling
   changes both spatially and temporally. Upwelling becomes intensified
   near Cape Beddouza, with most upwelling occurring within similar to 40
   km from shore although significant values may reach as far as 120 km
   offshore north of Cape Beddouza; at these locations the offshore
   integrated upwelling reaches as much as 4 times the offshore Ekman
   transport. In the Cape Beddouza area (32 degrees N to 33 degrees N),
   upwelling is negligible in February but intensifies in autumn, reaching
   as much as 3 times the offshore Ekman transport.

AB The genesis of tropical cyclones (TCs) over Indian seas comprising of
   Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Arabian Sea (AS) is highly seasonal with primary
   maximum in postmonsoon season (mid-September to December) and secondary
   maximum during premonsoon season (April and May). The present study is
   focused to demonstrate changes in genesis and intensity of TCs over
   Indian seas in warming environment. For this purpose, observational data
   of TCs, obtained from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), are
   analyzed. The sea surface temperature (SST), surface wind speed, and
   potential evaporation factor (PEF), obtained from the International
   Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), are also analyzed to
   examine the possible linkage with variations in TC activities over
   Indian seas. The study period has been divided into two epochs: past
   cooling period (PCP, period up to 1950) and current warming period (CWP,
   period after 1950) based on SST anomaly (became positive from 1950) over
   the BoB and AS. The study reveals that the number of severe cyclones
   (SCS) increases significantly (statistically significant at 99%
   confidence level) by about 41% during CWP though no such significant
   change is observed in cyclonic disturbances (CDs) and cyclones (CS) over
   Indian seas. It is also observed that the rate of dissipation of CS and
   SCS over Indian seas has been decreasing considerably by about 63 and
   71%, respectively, during CWP. The analysis shows that the BoB
   contributes about 75% in each category of TCs and remaining 25% by the
   AS towards total of Indian seas. A detailed examination on genesis and
   intensity of TC over both the basins and the seasons illustrates that
   significant enhancement of SCS by about 65% during CWP is confined to
   the postmonsoon season of the BoB. Further, the BoB is sub-divided into
   northern, central, and southern sectors and the AS into western and
   eastern sectors based on genesis of TCs and SST gradient. Results show
   that in postmonsoon season during CWP, the number of SCS increases
   significantly by about 71% in southern BoB and 300% over western AS.

AB Analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) from coastal buoys suggests
   that the summertime over-shelf water temperature off the U. S. West
   Coast has been declining during the past 30 years at an average rate of
   -0.19 degrees C decade(-1). This cooling trend manifests itself more
   strongly off south-central California than off Oregon and northern
   California. The variability and trend in the upwelling north of off San
   Francisco are positively correlated with those of the equatorward wind,
   indicating a role of offshore Ekman transport in the north. In contrast,
   Ekman pumping associated with wind stress curls better explains the
   stronger and statistically more significant cooling trend in the south.
   While the coast-wide variability and trend in SST are strongly
   correlated with those of large-scale modes of climate variability, they
   in general fail to explain the southward intensification of the trend in
   SST and wind stress curl. This result suggests that the local wind
   stress curl, often topographically forced, may have played a role in the
   upwelling trend pattern.

AB Possible influences of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on winter
   shipping in the North Pacific (NP) are investigated using marine
   observations contained in the International Comprehensive
   Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). Shipping frequency is interpreted
   using the number of ship reports accumulated in each 2 degrees x 2
   degrees box-space throughout the winter season. Analyses reveal that
   shipping across the NP follows major "great circle" routes from the
   South China Sea (SCS) along the coasts of East Asia and Japan before
   heading eastward along the open ocean north of the Aleutian Islands
   toward the western coasts of North America. The above routes are shorter
   in navigational distance and avoid strong winds and high waves in the
   regions south of the Aleutian Islands caused by the Aleutian low.
   In the far north NP, total shipping frequency exhibits evident
   interdecadal variability. El Nino tends to weaken ocean waves in these
   regions. Better maritime conditions facilitate shipping efficiency and
   result in decreases in navigation times and the number of ship reports,
   yielding a negative correlation between interannual components of
   Nino-3.4 SST and shipping frequency. In the Philippine Sea and the
   northern SCS, total shipping frequency also exhibits clear interdecadal
   variability. El Nino tends to weaken prevailing northeasterly flows and
   trade winds, leading to weakened ocean waves and decreased navigation
   times and ship-report numbers. Interannual components of Nino-3.4 SST
   and shipping frequency are negatively correlated. Overall, ENSO's
   influences on winter shipping in the western and northern NP are
   indiscernible in the aspect of total shipping frequency, but are notable
   in the interannual-variability aspect of shipping.

AB Seasonal-to-multidecadal applications that require ocean surface energy
   fluxes often require accuracies of surface turbulent fluxes to be 5 W
   m(-2) or better. While there is little doubt that uncertainties in the
   flux algorithms and input data can cause considerable errors, the impact
   of temporal averaging has been more controversial. The biases resulting
   from using monthly averaged winds, temperatures, and humidities in the
   bulk aerodynamic formula (i.e., the so-called classical method) to
   estimate the monthly mean latent heat fluxes are shown to be substantial
   and spatially varying in a manner that is consistent with most prior
   work. These averaging-related biases are linked to nonnegligible
   submonthly covariances between the wind, temperature, and humidity. To
   provide additional insight into the averaging-related bias, the
   methodology behind the third-generation Florida State University monthly
   mean surface flux product (FSU3) is detailed to highlight additional
   sources of errors in gridded datasets. The FSU3 latent heat fluxes
   suffer from this averaging-related bias, which can be as large as 90 W
   m(-2) in western boundary current regions during winter and can exceed
   40 W m(-2) in synoptically active portions of the tropics. The regional
   impacts of these biases on the mixed layer temperature tendency are
   shown to demonstrate that the error resulting from applying the
   classical method is physically substantial.

   Atlantic of the United States. Methods Barnacle surveys were conducted
   along the east coast of the United States in 1963 and 2007. Presence,
   absence and abundance data were collected and the time periods were
   compared. Transplant experiments monitoring survival with relation to
   temperature were conducted upon S. balanoides along the more southerly
   portion of their range, and modelling predicting barnacle survival with
   relation to biogeography was completed. Results The southern limit of S.
   balanoides has contracted approximately 350 km to the north. Main
   conclusions The changes thus far observed in climate along the east
   coast of the United States have contributed to the southern limit range
   contraction of S. balanoides. Further changes in the biogeography of S.

AB The coupled variability of the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and
   atmosphere-ocean surface heat fluxes over the Bay of Biscay (Eastern
   North Atlantic) has been analyzed. Daily surface heat fluxes from
   different meteorological reanalyses are combined with a high resolution
   reconstructed satellite SST data set by means of Lagged Maximum
   Covariance Analysis (MCA). Lagged MCA is applied at different spatial
   scales. Its results are interpreted within the framework of Hasselmann's
   stochastic climate model. The surface heat-flux feedback on SST is
   confirmed to be generally negative. No clear relation is found between
   the first MCA expansion series and the leading Sea Level Pressure (SLP)
   patterns. However, a clear relation is found between the second
   expansion series and the leading SLP Principal Component (PC) when the
   atmosphere leads the ocean. Spatial patterns of anomalies of the SST and
   of the SST tendency are found to be related by a 4 day lag. The same
   reconstructed satellite SST and reanalysis heat fluxes are combined to
   estimate the feedbacks related to the surface heat fluxes. The
   traditional procedure used to compute the surface heat-flux feedbacks
   from monthly data is adapted for daily data. High resolution maps of the
   heat-flux feedback are derived for the annual and seasonal cases for the
   Bay of Biscay. Feedbacks related to turbulent (latent and sensible heat)
   fluxes are shown to dominate over the radiative ones. Special attention
   is paid to small-scale features present in both Lagged Covariance
   patterns and surface heat-flux feedback estimates.

AB An adequate understanding of the ocean-atmosphere interface is important
   for understanding climate variability on different time scales. Thus,
   this research focuses on surface heat fluxes over seasonal scales and
   their changes during El Nino and La Nina along the eastern Pacific coast
   (10 degrees N-40 degrees S), consistent with oceanographic and
   meteorological fields. We used a wide range of up-to-date databases, new
   mean monthly heat air-sea fluxes (NOCS Flux Dataset v2.0) and
   complementary global databases (SODA reanalysis, SeaWiFS). The results
   reported here show that of all the fluxes contributing to net heat flux
   (Q(net)), net shortwave radiation (Q(sw)) is the term that warms and is
   most dominant, and latent heat flux (Q(lat)) is the term that most
   contributes to cooling. Considering seasonal variability, Q(sw)
   reduction due to cloud cover in the latter half of the year was
   associated with the presence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and
   the stratus cloud deck at 10 degrees N-Eq and Eq-30 degrees S,
   respectively. The smaller seasonal amplitude south of 30 degrees S was
   associated with the southern coastal jet that develops along the eastern
   flank of the low-level circulation over the southeast anticyclonic
   Pacific. During El Nino and La Nina, the most significant change was
   observed for Q(lat) in the first half of the year, between the equator
   and the Peruvian coast. Q(lat) tended to cool (warm) during El Nino (La
   Nina), acting as a negative feedback. Specifically for Q(lat), we found
   that the air-sea specific humidity difference (rather than the wind)
   played a prominent role in both El Nino - Southern Oscillation phases.
   The sum of Q(net) and the shortwave radiation that penetrates through
   the base of the mixed layer was compared with the sea surface
   temperature tendency and was discussed.

AB We analyzed and compared Mediterranean mesozooplankton time series
   spanning 1957-2006 from six coastal stations in the Balearic, Ligurian,
   Tyrrhenian, North and Middle Adriatic and Aegean Sea. Our analysis
   focused on fluctuations of major zooplankton taxonomic groups and their
   relation with environmental and climatic variability. Average seasonal
   cycles and interannual trends were derived. Stations spanned a large
   range of trophic status from oligotrophic to moderately eutrophic.
   Intra-station analyses showed (1) coherent multi-taxa trends off
   Villefranche sur mer that diverge from the previous results found at
   species level, (2) in Baleares, covariation of zooplankton and water
   masses as a consequence of the boundary hydrographic regime in the
   middle Western Mediterranean, (3) decrease in trophic status and
   abundance of some taxonomic groups off Naples, and (4) off Athens, an
   increase of zooplankton abundance and decrease in chlorophyll possibly
   caused by reduction of anthropogenic nutrient input, increase of
   microbial components, and more efficient grazing control on
   phytoplankton. (5) At basin scale, the analysis of temperature revealed
   significant positive correlations between Villefranche, Trieste and
   Naples for annual and/or winter average, and synchronous abrupt cooling
   and warming events centered in 1987 at the same three sites. After
   correction for multiple comparisons, we found no significant
   correlations between climate indices and local temperature or
   zooplankton abundance, nor between stations for zooplankton abundance,
   therefore we suggest-that-for these coastal stations local drivers
   (climatic, anthropogenic) are dominant and that the link between local
   and larger scale of climate should be investigated further if we are to
   understand zooplankton fluctuations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   each proxy record to large-scale circulation indices from the Pacific,

   analyse the potential of this newly expanded palaeoclimate network to
   collectively represent predictands (sea surface temperature, sea level
   pressure, surface air temperature and precipitation) commonly used in
   climate reconstructions. The key dynamical centres-of-action of the
   equatorial Indo-Pacific are well captured by the palaeoclimate network,
   indicating that there is considerable reconstruction potential in this
   region, particularly in the post AD 1600 period when a number of long
   coral records are available. Current spatiotemporal gaps in data
   coverage and regions where significant potential for future proxy
   collection exists are discussed. We then highlight the need for new and
   extended records from key dynamical regions of the Southern Hemisphere.
   Although large-scale climate field reconstructions for the SH are in
   their infancy, we report that excellent progress in the development of
   regional proxies now makes plausible estimates of continental- to
   hemispheric-scale climate variations possible.

AB The most widely accepted characterization of the Madden-Julian
   oscillation (MJO) is the bivariate index developed by Wheeler and
   Hendon. This index relies in part on satellite-based observations of
   outgoing longwave radiation and thus is not defined for the presatellite
   era. The MJO is known to have a strong signature in surface pressure,
   and daily measurements of this variable are available as far back as the
   late nineteenth century. This study undertakes a statistical
   reconstruction of the Wheeler and Hendon MJO index from 1905 to 2008
   based on tropical surface pressures estimated recently by the
   twentieth-century reanalysis project. The temporal and spectral
   properties of the reconstructed index are first shown to be consistent
   with the Wheeler and Hendon index over the common period (1979-2008).
   The reconstructed index is then validated over the earlier period
   (1905-1978) by examining its relationship with cloud cover, surface
   wind. precipitation, and sea level. These relationships are shown to be
   consistent with corresponding results obtained from the Wheeler and
   Hendon index over the shared period and stable over the earlier period.
   Finally, a simple damped harmonic oscillator model is used to gain new
   insights into the predictability of the MJO index and also demonstrate
   consistency between the reconstructed index and the Wheeler and Hendon
   index. These results give confidence in the validity of the historical
   reconstruction of the MJO index over the last century.

   are consistent between day and night within similar to 0.01 K.
   Satellite-in situ differences are correlated with differences in
   observation time, because of the diurnal warming and cooling of the
   ocean. The data are used to verify the average behaviour of physical and
   empirical models of the warming/cooling rates.
   Systematic differences between adjusted AATSR and in-situ SSTs against
   latitude, total column water vapour (TCWV), and wind speed are less than
   0.1 K, for all except the most extreme cases (TCWV <5 kg m(-2), TCWV >60
   kg m(-2)). For all types of retrieval except the nadir-only two-channel
   (N2), regional biases are less than 0.1 K for 80% of the ocean. Global
   comparison against drifting buoys shows night time dual-view two-channel
   (D2) SSTs are warm by 0.06 +/- 0.23 K and dual-view three-channel (D3)
   SSTs are warm by 0.06 +/- 0.21 K (day-time 02: 0.07 +/- 0.23 K).
   Nadir-only results are N2: 0.03 +/- 0.33 K and N3: 0.03 +/- 0.19 K
   showing the improved inter-algorithm consistency to similar to 0.02 K.
   This represents a marked improvement from the existing operational
   retrieval algorithms for which inter-algorithm inconsistency is >0.5 K.
   Comparison against tropical moored buoys, which are more accurate than
   drifting buoys, gives lower error estimates (N3: 0.02 +/- 0.13 K, 02:
   0.03 +/- 0.18 K). Comparable results are obtained for ATSR-2, except
   that the ATSR-2 SSTs are around 0.1 K warm compared to AATSR. (C) 2011

AB In situ data are widely used to provide a ground truth for the
   calibration and validation of satellite sea-surface temperature (SST)
   retrievals. They are also used to monitor long-term changes in the
   climate. For these applications, and others, it is necessary to
   understand the uncertainties in the data. Near-coincident SST
   observations from the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR)
   and in situ platforms were used to understand the characteristics of
   errors in the measurements. The mean random error on the AATSR
   retrievals was found to be 0.14 K. The in situ errors were modelled as a
   constant offset plus a random error. For ships, the standard deviation
   of the constant offset was estimated to be 0.71 K and the mean random
   error was 0.74 K. For drifting buoys, the standard deviation of the
   constant offset was estimated to be 0.29 K and the mean random error was
   0.26 K. These results suggest that there is a need to revisit current
   assessments of the adequacy of in situ observing systems. The trend in
   global-average SST between 1991 and 2007 calculated from in situ data
   was compared to its counterpart calculated from the ATSR instruments.
   The in situ record warms more slowly than the ATSR record, probably due
   to a decrease in the fraction of relatively warm-biassed ship
   observations contributing to the global-average SST over the period and
   a corresponding increase in the fraction of relatively unbiassed
   drifting buoy observations. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

AB A self-consistent mechanistic model is considered for the response of

   parameters are evaluated by using an atmospheric general circulation
   model (AGCM) control run, AGCM sensitivity experiments, and observation
   data of the NCEP reanalysis and ICOADS sea surface temperature (SST).
   Zonal wind anomaly induced over SCS from the surrounding weather system
   without any effect from SCS precipitation anomaly is regarded as the
   remote forcing for SCS monsoon. The remote forcing directly affects SCS
   monsoon variability through the water vapor transport and
   Convective-Wind-Evaporation (CWE), and indirectly through the reduction
   of SST. The effect of the activated zonal wind induced-reduction of SST
   is much smaller than that of CWE and plays a role in suppressing SCS
   precipitation. This result suggests that the SST reduction contributes
   to stabilize the monsoon variability over SCS in summer through local
   air-sea coupling. On the other hand, present study also suggests that
   monsoon precipitation contribute to reduce SST through the change in the
   local circulation.

AB Filaments are narrow, shallow structures of cool water originating from
   the coast. They are typical features of the four main eastern boundary
   upwelling systems (EBUS). In spite of their significant biological and
   chemical roles, through the offshore exportation of nutrient-rich
   waters, the physical processes that generate them are still not
   completely understood. This paper is a process-oriented study of
   filament generation mechanisms. Our goal is twofold: firstly, to obtain
   a numerical solution able to correctly represent the characteristics of
   the filament off Cape Ghir (30 degrees 38'N, northwest Africa) in the
   Canary EBUS and secondly, to explain its formation by a simple mechanism
   based on the balance of potential vorticity.
   The first goal is achieved by the use of the ROMS model (Regional Ocean
   Modeling System) with embedded domains around Cape Ghir, with a
   horizontal resolution going up to 1.5 km for the finest domain. The
   latter gets its initial and boundary conditions from a parent solution
   and is forced by climatological, high-resolution atmospheric fields. The
   modeled filaments display spatial, temporal and physical characteristics
   in agreement with the available in situ and satellite observations. This
   model solution is used as a reference to compare the results with a set
   of process-oriented experiments. These experiments allow us to reach the
   second objective. The solutions serve to highlight the contributions of
   various processes on the filament generation. Since the study is focused
   on general processes present under climatological forcing conditions,
   inter-annual forcing is not necessary.
   The underlying idea for the filament generation is the balance of
   potential vorticity in the Canary EBUS: the upwelling jet is
   characterized by negative relative vorticity and flows southward along a
   narrow band of uniform potential vorticity. In the vicinity of the cape,
   an injection of relative vorticity induced by the wind breaks the
   existing vorticity balance. The upwelling jet is prevented from
   continuing its way southward and has to turn offshore to follow lines of
   equal potential vorticity.
   The model results highlight the essential role of wind, associated with
   the particular topography (coastline and bottom) around the cape. The
   mechanism presented here is general and thus can be applied to other
   EBUS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   were not intercalibrated, then it could lead to intersatellite biases of
   1 degrees C in the air temperature and 1-2 g kg(-1) in the specific

   the instantaneous (matched within a half-hour) root-mean-square (RMS)
   errors of HIRS retrievals are 1.50 degrees C for air temperature and
   0.86 g kg(-1) for specific humidity. Compared to a large set of

AB Existing historical records of sea-surface temperature extending back to
   the mid-1800s are a valuable source of information about climate
   variability on interannual and decadal time-scales. However, the
   temporal and spatial irregularity of these data make them difficult to
   use in climate research, where gridded and complete data fields are
   expected for both statistical analysis and forcing numerical models.
   Infilling methods based on constraining the solution to the linear space
   spanned by the leading eigenvectors of the global-scale covariance,
   otherwise known as reduced-space methods, have proven very successful in
   creating gridded estimates of sea-surface temperature. These methods are
   especially useful for infilling the vast regions of unobserved ocean
   typical of the earliest segments of the data record. Regional
   variability, on the other hand, is not well represented by these
   methods, especially in data-poor regions. Here we present a method for
   augmenting the established large-scale reconstruction methods with a
   statistical model of the mid-scale variability. Using high quality
   sea-surface temperature data from the last 30 years including
   satellite-derived records, we specify a spatially non-stationary,
   anisotropic covariance model for the mid-scale sea-surface temperature
   variability. With the parameters of the covariance model estimated from
   the modern record, historical observations are used for conditioning the
   posterior distribution. Specifically, we form the expected value and
   correlated uncertainty of the mid-scales as well as generating samples
   from the posterior.
   While this work focuses on a limited domain in the midlatitude North
   Atlantic Ocean, themethod employed here can be extended to global
   reconstructions. Copyright (C) 2011 RoyalMeteorological Society

AB To analyze the probability density distributions of surface turbulent
   heat fluxes, the authors apply the two-parametric modified
   Fisher-Tippett (MFT) distribution to the sensible and latent turbulent
   heat fluxes recomputed from 6-hourly NCEP-NCAR reanalysis state
   variables for the period from 1948 to 2008. They derived the mean
   climatology and seasonal cycle of the location and scale parameters of
   the MFT distribution. Analysis of the parameters of probability
   distributions identified the areas where similar surface turbulent
   fluxes are determined by the very different shape of probability density
   functions. Estimated extreme turbulent heat fluxes amount to 1500-2000 W
   m(-2) (for the 99th percentile) and can exceed 2000 W m(-2) for higher
   percentiles in the subpolar latitudes and western boundary current
   regions. Analysis of linear trends and interannual variability in the
   mean and extreme fluxes shows that the strongest trends in extreme
   fluxes (more than 15 W m(-2) decade(-1)) in the western boundary current
   regions are associated with the changes in the shape of distribution. In
   many regions changes in extreme fluxes may be different from those for
   the mean fluxes at interannual and decadal time scales. The correlation
   between interannual variability of the mean and extreme fluxes is
   relatively low in the tropics, the Southern Ocean, and the Kuroshio
   Extension region. Analysis of probability distributions in turbulent
   fluxes has also been used in assessing the impact of sampling errors in
   the Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS)-based surface flux climatologies,
   allowed for the estimation of the impact of sampling in extreme fluxes.
   Although sampling does not have a visible systematic effect on mean
   fluxes, sampling uncertainties result in the underestimation of extreme
   flux values exceeding 100 W m(-2) in poorly sampled regions.

AB Interannual variability of high-wind occurrence over the North Atlantic
   is investigated based on observations from the satellite-borne Special
   Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I). Despite no wind direction being
   included, SSM/I data capture major features of high-wind frequency (HWF)
   quite well. Climatology maps show that HWF is highest in winter and is
   close to zero in summer. Remarkable interannual variability of HWF is
   found in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream, over open sea south of
   Iceland, and off Cape Farewell, Greenland. On interannual scales, HWF
   south of Iceland has a significant positive correlation with the North
   Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). An increase in the mean westerlies and
   storm-track intensity during a positive NAO event cause HWF to increase
   in this region. In the vicinity of the Gulf Stream, HWF is significantly
   correlated with the difference between sea surface temperature and
   surface air temperature (SST - SAT), indicative of the importance of
   atmospheric instability. Cross-frontal wind and an SST gradient are
   important for the instability of the marine atmospheric boundary layer
   on the warm flank of the SST front. Off Cape Farewell, high wind occurs
   in both westerly and easterly tip jets. Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT)
   data show that variability in westerly (easterly) HWF off Cape Farewell
   is positively (negatively) correlated with the NAO.

AB Synoptic weather observations from ships throughout the World Ocean have
   been analyzed to produce a climatology of total cloud cover and the
   amounts of nine cloud types. About 54 million observations contributed
   to the climatology, which now covers 55 years from 1954 to 2008. In this
   work, interannual variations of seasonal cloud amounts are analyzed in
   10 degrees grid boxes. Long-term variations O(5-10 yr), coherent across
   multiple latitude bands, remain present in the updated cloud data. A
   comparison to coincident data on islands indicates that the coherent
   variations are probably spurious. An exact cause for this behavior
   remains elusive. The globally coherent variations are removed from the
   gridbox time series using a Butterworth filter before further analysis.
   Before removing the spurious variation, the global average time series
   of total cloud cover over the ocean shows low-amplitude, long-term
   variations O(2%) over the 55-yr span. High-frequency, year-to-year
   variation is seen O(1%-2%).
   Among the cloud types, the most widespread and consistent relationship
   is found for the extensive marine stratus and stratocumulus clouds (MSC)
   over the eastern parts of the subtropical oceans. Substantiating and
   expanding upon previous work, strong negative correlation is found
   between MSC and sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern North
   Pacific, eastern South Pacific, eastern South Atlantic, eastern North
   Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean west of Australia. By contrast, a
   positive correlation between cloud cover and SST is seen in the central
   Pacific. High clouds show a consistent low-magnitude positive
   correlation with SST over the equatorial ocean.
   In regions of persistent MSC, time series show decreasing MSC amount.
   This decrease could be due to further spurious variation within the
   data. However, the decrease combined with observed increases in SST and
   the negative correlation between marine stratus and sea surface
   temperature suggests a positive cloud feedback to the warming sea
   surface. The observed decrease of MSC has been partly but not completely
   offset by increasing cumuliform clouds in these regions; a similar
   decrease in stratiform and increase in cumuliform clouds had previously
   been seen over land.
   Interannual variations of cloud cover in the tropics show strong
   correlation with an ENSO index.

AB Ocean surface turbulent fluxes play an important role in the energy and
   water cycles of the atmosphere-ocean coupled system, and several flux
   products have become available in recent years. Here, turbulent fluxes
   from 6 widely used reanalyses, 4 satellite-derived flux products, and 2
   combined product are evaluated by comparison with direct covariance
   latent heat (LH) and sensible heat (SH) fluxes and inertial-dissipation
   wind stresses measured from 12 cruises over the tropics and mid- and
   high latitudes. The biases range from -3.0 to 20.2 W m(-2) for LH flux,
   from -1.4 to 6.0 W m(-2) for SH flux, and from -7.6 to 7.9 x 10(-3) N
   m(-2) for wind stress. These biases are small for moderate wind speeds
   but diverge for strong wind speeds (>10 m s(-1)). The total flux biases
   are then further evaluated by dividing them into uncertainties due to
   errors in the bulk variables and the residual uncertainty. The
   bulk-variable-caused uncertainty dominates many products' SH flux and
   wind stress biases. The biases in the bulk variables that contribute to
   this uncertainty can be quite high depending on the cruise and the
   variable. On the basis of a ranking of each product's flux, it is found
   that the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications
   (MERRA) is among the "best performing" for all three fluxes. Also, the
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim
   reanalysis (ERA-Interim) and the National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction-Department of Energy (NCEP-DOE) reanalysis are among the best
   performing for two of the three fluxes. Of the satellite-derived
   products, version 2b of the Goddard Satellite-Based Surface Turbulent
   Fluxes (GSSTF2b) is among the best performing for two of the three
   fluxes. Also among the best performing for only one of the fluxes are
   the 40-yr ERA (ERA-40) and the combined product objectively analyzed
   air-sea fluxes (OAFlux). Direction for the future development of ocean
   surface flux datasets is also suggested.

   models used in this study were Regional Atmospheric Modeling System
   (RAMS) and Comprehensive Air quality Model with eXtensions (CAMx) for
   meteorological and photochemical ozone fields, respectively.
   Based on buoy observations, the sea surface temperature (SST) had a
   noticeable influence on the near surface wind field and distribution of
   photochemical ozone because the mean SST near Gwangyang Bay changed by
   2.8 degrees C over the five day period. Sea breeze with temporally
   varied SST was better represented than that estimated without the SST
   variation. Temporally changed SST distribution and its impact are more
   crucial factors for estimating the ozone concentration under weak
   synoptic conditions. And the accuracy of the estimated ozone
   concentration associated with the time varied SST tends to depend on the
   distance from the coastline. The acquisition of ocean conditions,
   including temporal variation in the SST, is indispensible for assessing
   and predicting the air quality, especially in well urbanized area near

   Earth's climate system. The Mg/Ca composition of Globigerinoides ruber
   (white) has been calibrated and applied for a number of tropical and
   extratropical paleo-SST reconstructions, though validation studies of
   the proxy against instrumental observations are relatively scarce. Here
   we present a validation of G. ruber Mg/Ca-derived SSTs against
   instrumental summer values, firstly from the modern seasonal water
   column perspective, and secondly from a 20th century observational time
   series. The study occurs in the San Lazaro Basin (SLB), one of the
   marginal basins in the NE Pacific known for very high sedimentation
   rates, excellent preservation, laminated sequences, and the ability to
   record upwelling processes on high-resolution timescales, from
   interannual climatic variability (El Nino /Southern Oscillation (ENSO))
   to interdecadal (e. g., the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)). Results
   suggest that the proxy best reflects the summer season. The
   proxy-instrument time-series comparison for summer SSTs displays
   remarkable agreement, driven largely by ENSO cycles for the past
   century, with some events missing due to scarcity of foraminiferal
   specimens and/or lack of sufficient temporal resolution. This study
   validates the G. ruber Mg/Ca proxy for summer SSTs in this region, and
   suggests its high fidelity to reconstruct summer SST from SLB over
   longer timescales to record multi-decadal and multi-centennial
   variabilities. Citation: Mortyn, P. G., J. C. Herguera, and M. A.

AB It has long been acknowledged that there are two types of El Nino
   events, i.e., the eastern Pacific El Nino (EE) and the central Pacific
   El Nino (CE), according to the initial position of the anomalous warm
   water and its propagation direction. In this paper, the oceanic and
   atmospheric evolutions and the possible mechanisms of the two types of
   El Nino events were examined. It is found that all the El Nino events,
   CE or EE, could be attributed to the joint impacts of the eastward
   advection of warm water from the western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) and
   the local warming in the equatorial eastern Pacific. Before the
   occurrence of CE events, WPWP had long been in a state of being
   anomalous warm, so the strength of eastward advection of warm water was
   much stronger than that of EE, which played a major role in the
   formation of CE. While for the EE events, most contribution came from
   the local warming of the equatorial eastern Pacific. It is further
   identified that the immediate cause leading to the difference of the two
   types of El Nino events was the asynchronous variations of the Southern
   Oscillation (SO) and the Northern Oscillation (NO) as defined by Chen in
   1984. When the transition from the positive phase of the NO (NO(+)) to
   NO(-) was prior to that from SO(+) to SO(-), there would be eastward
   propagation of westerly anomalies from the tropical western Pacific
   induced by NO and hence the growth of warm sea surface temperature
   anomalies in WPWP and its eastward propagation. This was followed by
   lagged SO-induced weakening of southeast trade winds and local warming
   in the equatorial eastern Pacific. These were conducive to the
   occurrence of the CE. On the contrary, the transition from SO+ to SO(-)
   leading the transition of NO would favor the occurrence of EE type
   events.

AB Two sea surface temperature (SST) time series, the Extended
   Reconstructed SST version 3 (ERSST.v3) and the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and
   Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST), are used to investigate SST
   multidecadal variability in the Mediterranean Sea and to explore
   possible connections with other regions of the global ocean. The
   consistency between these two time series and the original International
   Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Dataset version 2.5 (ICOADS 2.5) over the
   Mediterranean Sea is investigated, evaluating differences from monthly
   to multidecadal scales. From annual to longer time scales, the two time
   series consistently describe the same trends and multidecadal
   oscillations and agree with Mediterranean ICOADS SSTs. At monthly time
   scales the two time series are less consistent with each other because
   of the evident annual cycle that characterizes their difference.
   The subsequent analysis of the Mediterranean annual SST time series,
   based on lagged-correlation analysis, multitaper method (MTM), and
   singular spectral analysis (SSA), revealed the presence of a significant
   oscillation with a period of about 70 yr, very close to that of the
   Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO). An extension of the analysis to
   other World Ocean regions confirmed that the predominance of this
   multidecadal signal with respect to longer period trends is a unique
   feature of the Mediterranean and North Atlantic Ocean, where it reaches
   its maximum at subpolar latitudes. Signatures of multidecadal
   oscillations are also found in the global SST time series after removing
   centennial and longer-term components.
   The analysis also reveals that Mediterranean SST and North Atlantic
   indices are significantly correlated and coherent for periods longer
   than about 40 yr. For time scales in the range 40-55 yr the coherence
   between the Mediterranean and subpolar gyre temperatures is higher than
   the coherence between the Mediterranean SST and North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) or AMO. Finally, the results of the analysis are
   discussed in the light of possible climate mechanisms that can couple
   the Mediterranean Sea with the North Atlantic and the Global Ocean.

AB Atmospheric effects of sea surface temperature (SST) fronts along the
   Kuroshio and Kuroshio Extension (K-KE) are investigated by examining
   spatial characteristics of the climatological sea level pressure (SLP),
   surface winds and surface heat flux (Q) fields based on an in situ
   observation dataset. A hydrostatic effect of the SST front is observed
   during the northwesterly monsoon characterized by a westward-extending
   low-SLP wedge (trough) slightly south of the peak in Q along the K-KE.
   Ageostrophic surface westerlies crossing SLP isobars toward a trough
   center are found north of the low-SLP wedge apparently because of the
   eastward acceleration by the vertical mixing effect. This feature of the
   ageostrophic winds is less pronounced south of it, a north-south
   asymmetry arising as vertical mixing accelerates (decelerates) eastward
   ageostrophic winds north (south) of it. While the SLP trough near the
   SST front is found nearly year-round except for summer, its meridional
   location seasonally migrates probably due to the change in the mean
   surface flow.
   Regional atmospheric model experiments are conducted to examine the
   effect of the SST front on the overlying atmosphere. The observed
   features in winter are adequately simulated when high-resolution SST is
   prescribed as the boundary condition. The strong Q along the K-KE and
   resultant SLP trough and ageostrophic surface winds are absent when the
   SST boundary condition is smoothed in space to weaken the SST front.
   These results illustrate that the cross-frontal change in Q is of great
   importance to leave the SST imprint on the overlying atmosphere via
   hydrostatic and vertical mixing adjustments.

AB Decadal Sahelian rainfall variability was mainly driven by sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs) during the twentieth century. At the same time SSTs
   showed a marked long-term global warming (GW) trend. Superimposed on
   this long-term trend decadal and multi-decadal variability patterns are
   observed like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the
   inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Using an atmospheric general
   circulation model we investigate the relative contribution of each
   component to the Sahelian precipitation variability. To take into
   account the uncertainty related to the use of different SST data sets,
   we perform the experiments using HadISST1 and ERSSTv3 reconstructed
   sets. The simulations show that all three SST signals have a significant
   impact over West Africa: the positive phases of the GW and the IPO lead
   to drought over the Sahel, while a positive AMO enhances Sahel rainfall.
   The tropical SST warming is the main cause for the GW impact on Sahel
   rainfall. Regarding the AMO, the pattern of anomalous precipitation is
   established by the SSTs in the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. In
   turn, the tropical SST anomalies control the impact of the IPO component
   on West Africa. Our results suggest that the low-frequency evolution of
   Sahel rainfall can be interpreted as the competition of three factors:
   the effect of the GW, the AMO and the IPO. Following this
   interpretation, our results show that 50% of the SST-driven Sahel
   drought in the 1980s is explained by the change to a negative phase of
   the AMO, and that the GW contribution was 10%. In addition, the partial
   recovery of Sahel rainfall in recent years was mainly driven by the AMO.

   products. The analysis includes in situ-based (Florida State University
   fluxes, FSU3 and National Oceanography Centre, NOC), satellite-based
   (Hamburg Ocean-Atmosphere Parameters from Satellite data, HOAPS2 and the
   French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, IFREMER), hybrid
   (Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes, GSSTF2 and

   for Environmental Prediction, NCEPR2, Japanese 25-year reanalysis, JRA,
   and European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis,
   ERA-40) products. Objectives include documenting the varying analysis
   methodologies and quantifying the differences and similarities between
   the nine products. Recommendations are made for developers of future
   flux products and to guide users to select products most suitable for
   their application. The comparison examines turbulent fluxes of heat and
   momentum along with the forcing variables (air temperature, wind speed,
   humidity, and ocean skin temperature) that are necessary to estimate
   turbulent fluxes. The wide range of turbulent flux parameterisations,
   sampling patterns, and averaging techniques within the products are
   described, including some of the difficulties product differences pose
   when trying to compare or apply the individual products. Global
   comparisons of monthly means tend to reveal similar spatial patterns in
   latent heat flux (LHF) and sensible heat flux (SHF) for the nine
   products; however, the magnitudes and patterns of variability (expressed
   as maps of standard deviations) are widely different. Basin scale and
   regional analysis further reveals large differences in the products (in
   some cases the interquartile ranges (IQRs) do not overlap for different
   products), but also reveals potential sources of the differences. For
   example, some of the variations in LHF can be explained by large
   differences in the distribution of specific humidity between the
   products. As a final analysis, we examine how each product represents
   the variations in turbulent fluxes in the equatorial Pacific (EP) Ocean.
   This analysis provides an example of how the choice of a flux product,
   and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of that product, can
   alter research findings. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society

   correspond well after 1950, become gradually worse backward in time and
   are scattered before 1880. These differences are ascribed to the use of
   different interpolation methods for missing grids, treatments of

AB El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains the most important coupled
   ocean-atmosphere phenomenon to cause global climate variability on
   seasonal to interannual time scales. This paper addresses the need for a
   reliable ENSO index that allows for the historical definition of ENSO
   events in the instrumental record back to 1871. The Multivariate ENSO
   Index (MEI) was originally defined as the first seasonally varying
   principal component of six atmosphere-ocean (COADS) variable fields in
   the tropical Pacific basin. It provides for a more complete and flexible
   description of the ENSO phenomenon than single variable ENSO indices
   such as the SOI or Nino 3.4 SST. Here we describe our effort to boil the
   MEI concept down to its most essential components (based on SLP, SST) to
   enable historical analyses that more than double its period of record to
   1871-2005. The new MEI. ext confirms that ENSO activity went through a
   lull in the early-to mid-20th century, but was just about as prevalent
   one century ago as in recent decades. We diagnose strong relationships
   between peak amplitudes of ENSO events and their duration, as well as
   between their peak amplitudes and their spacing (periodicity). Our
   effort is designed to help with the assessment of ENSO conditions
   through as long a record as possible to be able to differentiate between
   'natural' ENSO behaviour in all its rich facets, and the 'Brave New
   World' of this phenomenon under evolving GHG-related climate conditions.
   So far, none of the behaviour of recent ENSO events appears
   unprecedented, including duration, onset timing, and spacing in the last
   few decades compared to a full century before then. Copyright (C) 2011

AB Release 2.5 of the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set

   extensive surface marine meteorological data collection. Building on
   extensive national and international partnerships, many new and improved
   contributing datasets have been processed into a uniform format and
   combined with the previous Release 2.4. The new data range from early
   non-instrumental ship observations to measurements initiated in the
   twentieth century from buoys and other automated platform types.
   Improvements to existing data include replacing preliminary Global
   Telecommunication System (GTS) receipts with more reliable, delayed mode
   reports for post-1997 data, and in the processing and quality control
   (QC) of humidity observations. Over the entire period of record, spatial
   and temporal coverage has been enriched and data and metadata quality
   has been improved. Along with the observations, now updated monthly in
   near real time, Release 2.5 includes quality-controlled monthly summary
   products for 2 latitude x 2 longitude (since 1800) and 1 x 1 boxes
   (since 1960), together with multiple options for access to the data and
   products. The measured and estimated data in Release 2.5 are subject to
   many technical changes, multiple archive sources, and historical events
   throughout the more than three-century record. Some of these data
   characteristics are highlighted, including known unresolved errors and
   inhomogeneities, which may impact climate and other research
   applications. Anticipated future directions for ICOADS aim to continue
   adding scientific value to the observations, products, and metadata, as
   well as strengthen the cooperative enterprise through expanded linkages
   to international initiatives and organisations. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal

   is a concerted, international effort to facilitate and encourage the
   recovery - through imaging and digitisation - of archived marine weather
   observations, platform and instrumental metadata and historical
   documentation, from many different countries. Non-instrumental
   observations of wind and weather have been recorded in ships' logbooks
   for hundreds of years, augmented by systematic instrumental observations
   of sea surface and air temperatures, barometric pressure and other
   meteorological (and oceanographic) elements largely since the
   mid-nineteenth century. Once digitised, these data are widely useful for
   climate studies and other avenues of scientific research - including
   oceanography, fisheries, maritime history and ecology-thus improvements
   seeking to address gaps and weaknesses in the currently available data
   record can be of major importance. In addition to documenting and
   prioritising archived ship logbook records for imaging and digitisation
   in support of that goal, RECLAIM provides expert assistance in the
   interpretation of historical marine records in relation to navigation,
   observational practices and recording. Since the project inception in
   2005, RECLAIM has facilitated, for example, recovery of logbooks of the
   Dutch and English East India Companies in the nineteenth century, and of
   the British Royal Navy of the twentieth century. Currently the project
   website includes reference lists, rescued UK and US marine documents,
   extensive UK archive reports and detailed inventories of ship movements.

AB The methods used to calculate a new in situ global dataset of air-sea
   exchanges, called the NOCS Flux Dataset v2.0, are described. The fluxes
   have been derived from in situ weather reports from Voluntary Observing
   Ships (VOS) covering the period 1973-2006. The reports have been
   adjusted for known biases and residual uncertainties estimated. The
   dataset is constructed using Optimal Interpolation (OI) using new
   estimates of random uncertainty in the observations. Daily fields have
   been calculated on a 1 degrees latitude by 1 degrees longitude grid,
   each grid box and time step have an associated uncertainty estimate.
   Monthly fields have been calculated from simple averages of the daily
   fields and monthly uncertainty estimates from the daily uncertainties,
   using estimates of the autocorrelation between the daily uncertainty
   estimates. The uncertainties due to the choice of flux parameterisation
   have not been accounted for. Bias adjustments applied to the data are
   shown to reduce trends in the data and to improve the consistency of
   estimates of air temperature, sea surface temperature (SST) and specific
   humidity. The bias adjustments also improve the agreement of NOCS v2.0
   with independent data from research moorings. Cross-validation of the
   dataset suggests that the uncertainty estimates are realistic, but that
   the uncertainties are probably underestimated in high variability
   regions and overestimated in regions with lower variability. Copyright

   over regions strongly connected with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
   With the aim of improving the skill of regional climate predictions in
   tropical and extratropical regions from intraseasonal to interannual
   time scales, a new Met Office global seasonal forecasting system
   (GloSea4) has been developed. This new system has been designed to be
   flexible and easy to upgrade so it can be fully integrated within the
   Met Office model development infrastructure. Overall, the analysis here
   shows an improvement of GloSea4 when compared to its predecessor.
   However, there are exceptions, such as the increased model biases that
   contribute to degrade the skill of Nino-3.4 SST forecasts starting in
   November. Global ENSO teleconnections and Madden-Julian oscillation
   anomalies are well represented in GloSea4. Remote forcings of the North
   Atlantic Oscillation by ENSO and the quasi-biennial oscillation are
   captured albeit the anomalies are weaker than those found in
   observations. Hindcast length issues and their implications for seasonal
   forecasting are also discussed.

AB A high-resolution numerical model study of the Canary Basin in the
   northeast subtropical Atlantic Ocean is presented. A long-term
   climatological solution from the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS)
   reveals mesoscale variability associated with the Azores and Canary
   Current systems, the northwest African coastal upwelling, and the Canary
   Island archipelago. The primary result concerns the Canary Current
   (CanC) which, in the solution, transports similar to 3 Sv southward in
   line with observations. The simulated CanC has a well-defined path with
   pronounced seasonal variability. This variability is shown to be
   mediated by the westward passage of two large annually excited
   counterrotating anomalous structures that originate at the African
   coast. The anomalies have a sea surface expression, permitting their
   validation using altimetry and travel at the phase speed of baroclinic
   planetary (Rossby) waves. The role of nearshore wind stress curl
   variability as a generating mechanism for the anomalies is confirmed
   through a sensitivity experiment forced by low-resolution winds. The
   resulting circulation is weak in comparison to the base run, but the
   propagating anomalies are still discernible, so we cannot discount a
   further role in their generation being played by annual reversals of the
   large-scale boundary flow that are known to occur along the African
   margin. An additional sensitivity experiment, where the Azores Current
   is removed by closing the Strait of Gibraltar presents the same
   anomalies and CanC behavior as the base run, suggesting that the CanC is
   rather insensitive to upstream variability from the Azores Current.

AB Biogeographic change in response to climate is a ratchet-like process,
   with gradual long term change punctuated by advances and retreats caused
   by extreme events. The winter of 1962-63 was the coldest winter since
   1740, and caused lasting widespread changes in intertidal populations in
   Europe. Against the background of several decades of gradual warming,
   the severely cold winter of 2009-10 provided an opportunity to test
   mechanistic hypotheses regarding the control of biogeographic limits,
   including recruitment failure and adult mortality. As a result of
   enhanced recruitment in cold conditions, the northern barnacle
   Semibalanus balanoides expanded its range in both France and Iberia at
   an average rate of 25 km year(-1). The northern polychaete Arenicola
   marina had high recruitment in northern France, which filled in a gap in
   its range in the central English Channel. The southern barnacles
   Chthamalus montagui and Chthamalus stellatus, which are sensitive to
   cold winters, suffered recruitment failure but no adult mortality at
   their northern limit in continental Europe. The southern limpet, Patella
   rustica and the southern polychaete Diopatra which are sensitive to cold
   summers, had virtually no change in distribution, as a result of the
   prior warm summer. The southern mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis
   suffered little adult mortality at its northern limit in continental
   Europe. Metapopulation models of future distribution, based on these
   mechanisms, and validated by hindcasts of historical biogeography,
   indicate that a regime shift will occur in northern Europe as southern
   species like Diopatra are able to invade the English Channel and from
   there enter the North Sea. These models and the historical biogeographic
   record confirm the view that biogeographic change is punctuated by
   population responses to extreme events. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The key aspect of the ocean circulation off Peru-Chile is the
   wind-driven upwelling of deep, cold, nutrient-rich waters that promote a
   rich marine ecosystem. It has been suggested that global warming may be
   associated with an intensification of upwelling-favorable winds.
   However, the lack of high-resolution long-term observations has been a
   limitation for a quantitative analysis of this process. In this study,
   we use a statistical downscaling method to assess the regional impact of
   climate change on the sea-surface wind over the Peru-Chile upwelling
   region as simulated by the global coupled general circulation model
   IPSL-CM4. Taking advantage of the high-resolution QuikSCAT wind product
   and of the NCEP reanalysis data, a statistical model based on multiple
   linear regressions is built for the daily mean meridional and zonal wind
   at 10 m for the period 2000-2008. The large-scale 10 m wind components
   and sea level pressure are used as regional circulation predictors. The
   skill of the downscaling method is assessed by comparing with the
   surface wind derived from the ERS satellite measurements, with in situ
   wind observations collected by ICOADS and through cross-validation. It
   is then applied to the outputs of the IPSL-CM4 model over stabilized
   periods of the pre-industrial, 2 x CO2 and 4 x CO2 IPCC climate
   scenarios. The results indicate that surface along-shore winds off
   central Chile (off central Peru) experience a significant
   intensification (weakening) during Austral winter (summer) in warmer
   climates. This is associated with a general decrease in intra-seasonal
   variability.

AB Free-living coralline algae lay down growth bands formed by areas of
   more and less calcified cells which, in certain species, are associated
   with winter and summer growth respectively. Band width and cell
   calcification of Lithothamnion glaciale from Scotland were compared to
   annual and seasonal cloud cover and sea surface temperature (SST). There
   was a negative relationship between summer calcification (the degree of
   cellular carbonate infilling) and winter cloud cover. Annual and summer
   SST were also negatively related to summer calcification. This indicates
   that summer calcification may be affected by the previous winter's cloud
   cover and that summer's/year's SST. No relationships between band width
   and cloud cover were observed. A cloud cover hindcast using summer
   calcification and SST indicated a modest rise in cloud cover trends from
   1910 to 2006 and a 12 (mean) year cyclicity in cloud cover, however, the
   latter may be associated with other site-specific factors. This study
   demonstrates the utility of densitometric algochronology in

AB Consistency and discrepancy of air-sea latent and sensible heat fluxes
   (LHF and SHF, respectively) in the Southern Ocean for current-day flux
   products are analyzed from climatology and interannual-to-decadal
   variability perspectives. Five flux products are examined, including the
   National Oceanography Centre, Southampton flux dataset version 2
   (NOCS2), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/Department of
   Energy Global Reanalysis 2 (NCEP-2), the 40-yr European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40), the Hamburg Ocean
   Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Data version 3
   (HOAPS-3), and the objectively analyzed air sea fluxes (OAFlux).
   Comparisons suggest that most datasets show encouraging agreement in the
   spatial distribution of the annual-mean LHF, the meridional profile of
   the zonal-averaged LHF, the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF)
   mode of the LHF and SHF, and the large-scale response of the LHF and SHF
   to the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO). However, substantial spatiotemporal discrepancies are
   noteworthy. The largest across-data scatter is found in the central
   Indian sector of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) for the
   annual-mean LHF, and in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the ACC for
   the annual-mean SHF, which is comparable to and even larger than their
   respective interannual variability. The zonal mean of the SHF varies
   widely across the datasets in the ACC. There is a large spread in the
   seasonal cycle for the LHF and SHF among the datasets, particularly in
   the cold season. The datasets show interannual variability of various
   amplitudes and decadal trends of different signs. The flux variability
   of the NOCS2 is substantially different from the other datasets.
   Possible attributions of the identified discrepancies for these flux
   products are discussed based on the availability of the input
   meteorological state variables.

   of cod cohorts to loss of zooplankton prey, for example following an oil

   possible zooplankton biomass reductions in the distribution area of the

   dynamics may guide which indirect effects to consider in environmental

AB Today, latent heat flux and precipitation over the global ocean surface
   can be determined from microwave satellite data as a basis for
   estimating the related fields of the ocean surface freshwater flux. The
   Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Data
   (HOAPS) is the only generally available satellite-based dataset with
   consistently derived global fields of both evaporation and precipitation
   and hence of freshwater flux for the period 1987-2005. This paper
   presents a comparison of the evaporation E, precipitation P, and the
   resulting freshwater flux E - P in HOAPS with recently available
   reference datasets from reanalysis and other satellite observation
   projects as well as in situ ship measurements. In addition, the humidity
   and wind speed input parameters for the evaporation are examined to
   identify sources for differences between the datasets. Results show that
   the general climatological patterns are reproduced by all datasets.
   Global mean time series often agree within about 10% of the individual
   products, while locally larger deviations may be found for all
   parameters. HOAPS often agrees better with the other satellite-derived
   datasets than with the in situ or the reanalysis data. The agreement
   usually improves in regions of good in situ sampling statistics. The
   biggest deviations of the evaporation parameter result from differences
   in the near-surface humidity estimates. The precipitation datasets
   exhibit large differences in highly variable regimes with the largest
   absolute differences in the ITCZ and the largest relative biases in the
   extratropical storm-track regions. The resulting freshwater flux
   estimates exhibit distinct differences in terms of global averages as
   well as regional biases. In comparison with long-term mean global river
   runoff data, the ocean surface freshwater balance is not closed by any
   of the compared fields. The datasets exhibit a positive bias in E - P of
   0.2 - 0.5 mm day(-1), which is on the order of 10% of the evaporation
   and precipitation estimates.

   affected by all detection limitations that characterize the measurement
   of rainfall with the addition of several complications, such as the
   indirect character of remote sensing precipitation estimation, the
   presence of frozen or snow-covered terrain, and the unknown vertical
   distribution of hydrometeors in the cloud column. Several methods for
   the retrieval of snowfall intensity from satellite have been proposed in
   recent times using passive and active sensors. No satisfactory answer to
   the general problem of quantitative snowfall intensity determination has
   been found to date, but several studies contribute to delineate a
   working framework for the future operational retrieval algorithms.

   wind stress (which is equivalent to the momentum flux) are described in

   change related trends in surface fluxes and impacts of extreme heat
   fluxes at high latitudes. Finally, some outstanding challenges are

   temperature over the past 20 years have affected cod in the wild.
   Seasonal opaque zone formation was related to winter and early spring.
   Timing of opaque zone formation was not influenced by either temperature
   or fish length, but increasing age led to slightly earlier but slower
   opaque zone formation. In contrast, there was a clear shift in the
   timing of translucent zone formation with temperature. In warm years,
   translucent growth occurs up to 22 days earlier than in colder periods.
   Increasing age and smaller size-at-age resulted in an earlier transition
   from opaque to translucent edge formation. Translucent zone formation
   appears indicative of increasing metabolic stress, and the earlier onset
   provides direct evidence of the impact of increasing sea temperatures on
   wild North Sea cod stocks.

AB The Spanish surface fishery operates mainly during the summer season in
   the waters of the Bay of Biscay. Sea surface temperature (SST) data
   recovered from satellite images are being used to improve the
   operational efficiency of fishing vessels (e. g. reduce search time and
   increase catch rate) and to improve the understanding of the variations
   in catch distribution and rate needed to properly manage fisheries. The
   images used for retrieval of SST often present gaps due to the existence
   of clouds or satellite malfunction periods. The data gaps can totally or
   partially affect the area of interest. Within this study, an application
   of a technique for the reconstruction of missing data called DINEOF
   (data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions) is analysed, with
   the aim of testing its applicability in operational SST retrieval during
   summer months. In this case study, the Bay of Biscay is used as the
   target area. Three months of SST Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, ranging from 1 May 2006 to 31 July
   2006, were used. The main objective of this work is to test the overall
   performance of this technique, under potential operational use for the
   support of the fleet during the summer fishing season. The study is
   designed to analyse the sensitivity of the results of this technique to
   several details of the methodology used in the reconstruction of SST,
   such as the number of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) retained,
   the handling of the seasonal cycle or the length (number of images) of
   the SST database used. The results are tested against independent SST
   data from International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS)
   ship reports and standing buoys and estimations of the error of the
   reconstructed SST fields are given.
   Conclusions show that over this area three months of data are enough for
   efficient SST reconstruction, which yields four EOFs as the optimal
   number needed for this case study. An extended EOF experiment with SST
   and SST with a lag of one day was carried out to analyse whether the
   autocorrelation of the SST data allows better performance in the SST
   reconstruction, although the experiment did not improve the results. The
   validation studies show that the reconstructed SSTs can be trusted, even
   when the amount of missing data is very high. The mean absolute
   deviation maps show that the error is greatest near to the coast and
   mainly in the upwelling areas close to the French and north-western
   Spanish coasts.

AB Ship-based measurements of sea surface wind speed display a spurious
   upward trend due to increases in anemometer height. To correct this
   bias, the authors constructed a new sea surface wind dataset from ship
   observations of wind speed and wind wave height archived in the
   International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). The
   Wave-and Anemometer-based Sea surface Wind (WASWind) dataset is
   available for wind velocity and scalar speed at monthly resolution on a
   4 degrees x 4 degrees longitude-latitude grid from 1950 to 2008. It
   substantially reduces the upward trend in wind speed through height
   correction for anemometer-measured winds, rejection of spurious Beaufort
   winds, and use of estimated winds from wind wave height. The reduced
   global upward trend is smallest among the existing global datasets of in
   situ observations and comparable with those of reanalysis products.
   Despite the significant reduction of globally averaged wind speed trend,
   WASWind features rich spatial structures in trend pattern, making it a
   valuable dataset for studies of climate changes on regional scales. Not
   only does the combination of ship winds and wind wave height
   successfully reproduce major modes of seasonal-to-decadal variability;
   its trend patterns are also physically consistent with sea level
   pressure (SLP) measurements. WASWind is in close agreement with wind
   changes in satellite measurements by the Special Sensor Microwave
   Imagers (SSM/Is) for the recent two decades. The agreement in trend
   pattern with such independent observations illustrates the utility of
   WASWind for climate trend analysis. An application to the South Asian
   summer monsoon is presented.

   and local Spanish newspapers. It includes all the storms coming from the
   Atlantic sector that have been detected during the winter season, from
   October to March, between 1929 and 2005. In order to validate this
   historical storm series, it has been compared with storms series
   identified from quasi-observational data and using different wave
   heights as thresholds to decide what is to be considered as a coastal
   storm. Nearly 2.6 reports per year about coastal storms are published in
   the press which correspond to waves of 3.6 m high or more and to
   prevailing winds from a direction ranging between SSW and WNW. A
   long-term positive trend has been detected for the complete storm
   series. If only the instrumental period is analysed, no significant
   trend is detected. It is suggested that this difference might be
   associated with the impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation over the
   occurrence of storms in this area.

AB Near-surface enhancement of turbulent mixing and vertical mixing
   coefficient for temperature owing to the effect of surface wave breaking
   is investigated using a two-dimensional (2-D) ocean circulation model
   with a tidal boundary condition in an idealized shelf sea. On the basis
   of the 2-D simulation, the effect of surface wave breaking on surface
   boundary layer deepening in the Yellow Sea in summer is studied
   utilizing a 3-D ocean circulation model. A well-mixed temperature
   surface layer in the Yellow Sea can be successfully reconstructed when
   the effect of surface wave breaking is considered. The diagnostic
   analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy equation shows that turbulent
   mixing is enhanced greatly in the Yellow Sea in summer by surface wave
   breaking. In addition, the diagnostic analysis of momentum budget and
   temperature budget also show that surface wave breaking has an evident
   contribution to the turbulent mixing in the surface boundary layer. We
   therefore conclude that surface wave breaking is an important factor in
   determining the depth of the surface boundary layer of temperature in
   the Yellow Sea in summer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international
   effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset
   spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure
   reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice
   distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need
   to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for
   validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century onall
   time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses
   an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background
   'first guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global
   numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global
   analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and
   also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis.
   The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric
   variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the
   present at 6-hourly temporal and 2 degrees spatial resolutions.
   Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the
   reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the
   extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to
   that of current three-day operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons
   over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with
   other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are
   equally encouraging.
   It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to
   the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic
   studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the
   long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation,
   the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific-North American
   pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The
   long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation
   also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the
   twentieth century. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society and

AB Recent studies have demonstrated that the annual mean barotropic
   currents over the East China and Yellow seas (ECYS) are forced primarily
   by the oceanic circulation in the open-ocean basin through the Kuroshio
   Current (KC), the western boundary current of the subtropical gyre in
   the North Pacific Ocean. The local wind stress forcing plays an
   important but secondary role. Those previous results were mainly
   qualitative and from a simple barotropic model forced by a steady wind
   stress field. They remain to be tested in a more complete 3-D model with
   both wind stress and buoyancy fluxes. In addition, the seasonal
   variability of major ECYS currents may involve different forcing
   mechanisms than their annually averaged fields do, and this can only be
   addressed when a seasonally varying forcing is used in the model. In
   this paper, we will address these issues by using a 3-D baroclinic
   model. Our results confirm the finding from the previous studies that
   the KC is the primary forcing mechanism for major annually mean currents
   in the ECYS, which include the Taiwan Strait Current, the Tsushima Warm
   Current, and the Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC), etc. However, the local
   monsoonal forcing plays a prominent role in modulating the seasonal
   variability of all major currents in the region. A deep northwestward
   intrusion of the YSWC in winter, for instance, is mainly due to a
   robustly developed China Coastal Current and Korea Coastal Current,
   which draw water along the Yellow Sea Trough to feed the southward flows
   along the west and east coasts of the Yellow Sea.

AB Previous studies suggested that the interannual variability of the
   maximum sea ice extent (MSIE) in the Sea of Okhotsk is not explained
   only by atmospheric conditions. In this study, we examined the effect of
   the ocean thermal condition on the determination of the MSIE based on
   observational data. We found that the MSIE is highly correlated with the
   sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean temperature around the East
   Kamchatska Current (EKC) in the Pacific in late autumn
   (November-December). The significant relationship between the MSIE and
   the SST cannot be fully explained by prevailing atmospheric
   variabilities. Considering that the inflow of EKC water to the Okhotsk
   Sea is strengthened in winter, advection of anomalous ocean temperature
   likely influences the MSIE. A multiple regression model constructed as a
   function of SST in the EKC and the air temperature at 850 hPa over the
   upwind region of the Okhotsk Sea in late autumn, which is another
   determinant factor for the MSIE, significantly improves the prediction
   skill for the MSIE: 70% of the variance of MSIE can be predicted at the
   stage of 2 to 3 months before the MSIE season. The SST in the EKC and
   the upwind air temperature are likely to control the sea ice extent in
   the northeastern and center to southern parts of the Okhotsk Sea,
   respectively.

   Satellite-observed night lights are used to identify measurement
   stations located in extreme darkness and adjust temperature trends of
   urban and periurban stations for nonclimatic factors, verifying that
   urban effects on analyzed global change are small. Because the GISS
   analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with
   meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the
   ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to
   estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are
   limited. We use simple 12 month (and n x 12) running means to improve
   the information content in our temperature graphs. Contrary to a popular
   misconception, the rate of warming has not declined. Global temperature
   is rising as fast in the past decade as in the prior 2 decades, despite
   year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Nino-La Nina cycle of
   tropical ocean temperature. Record high global 12 month running mean
   temperature for the period with instrumental data was reached in 2010.

AB Interactions within and between species complicate quantification of
   climate effects, by causing indirect, often delayed, effects of climate
   fluctuations and compensation of mortality. Here we identify direct and
   indirect climate effects by analysing unique Russian time-series data
   from the Norwegian Sea-Barents Sea ecosystem on the first life stages of
   cod, capelin, herring and haddock, their predators, competitors and
   zooplanktonic prey. By analysing growth and survival from one life stage
   to the next (eggs-larvae-juveniles-recruits), we find evidence for both
   bottom-up, direct and top-down effects of climate. Ambient zooplankton
   biomass predicts survival of all species, whereas ambient temperature
   mainly affects survival through effects on growth. In warm years, all
   species experienced improved growth and feeding conditions. Cohorts born
   following a warm year will, however, experience increased predation and
   competition because of increased densities of subadult cod and herring,
   leading to delayed climate effects. While climate thus affects early
   growth and survival through several mechanisms, only some of the
   identified mechanisms were found to be significant predictors of
   population growth. In particular, our findings exemplify that climate
   impacts are barely propagated to later life stages when density
   dependence is strong.

AB Environmental factors act on individual fishes directly and indirectly.
   The direct effects on rates and behaviour can be studied experimentally
   and in the field, particularly with the advent of ever smarter tags for
   tracking fishes and their environment. Indirect effects due to changes
   in food, predators, parasites and diseases are much more difficult to
   estimate and predict. Climate can affect all life-history stages through
   direct and indirect processes and although the consequences in terms of
   growth, survival and reproductive output can be monitored, it is often
   difficult to determine the causes. Investigation of cod Gadus morhua
   populations across the whole North Atlantic Ocean has shown large-scale
   patterns of change in productivity due to lower individual growth and
   condition, caused by large-scale climate forcing. If a population is
   being heavily exploited then a drop in productivity can push it into
   decline unless the level of fishing is reduced: the idea of a stable
   carrying capacity is a dangerous myth. Overexploitation can be avoided
   by keeping fishing mortality low and by monitoring and responding
   rapidly to changes in productivity. There are signs that this lesson has
   been learned and that G. morhua will continue to be a mainstay of the
   human diet.

   warm (May September) season using a reduced space optimal interpolation
   (RSOI) technique, in which the data is projected on a limited number of
   empirical orthogonal functions. I I This approach is validated on modern
   data that are sampled in a similar way as the early-instrumental data.
   The reconstruction for the November March period shows a large area with
   anomalously high temperatures from the point where the Gull. Stream
   separates from the coast until ca. 20 degrees W. A tongue of anomalous
   cool water is found at the eastern side of the North Atlantic basin,
   along the coast of Europe and northern Africa. In the northeastern South
   Atlantic. anomalously high temperatures are found. while temperatures in
   the southwestern South Atlantic are anomalously cool. For the March
   September season, anomalous temperatures in the South Atlantic are
   similar, but stronger, compared with those M the boreal cold season.
   Over the North Atlantic, there is not much similarity between the
   current SST reconstructions and those published in the late 1950s.

AB The twentieth-century trend in global-mean surface temperature was not
   monotonic: temperatures rose from the start of the century to the 1940s,
   fell slightly during the middle part of the century, and rose rapidly
   from the mid-1970s onwards(1). The warming-cooling-warming pattern of
   twentieth-century temperatures is typically interpreted as the
   superposition of long-term warming due to increasing greenhouse gases
   and either cooling due to a mid-twentieth century increase of sulphate
   aerosols in the troposphere(2-4), or changes in the climate of the
   world's oceans that evolve over decades (oscillatory multidecadal
   variability)(2,5). Loadings of sulphate aerosol in the troposphere are
   thought to have had a particularly important role in the differences in
   temperature trends between the Northern and Southern hemispheres during
   the decades following the Second World War(2-4). Here we show that the
   hemispheric differences in temperature trends in the middle of the
   twentieth century stem largely from a rapid drop in Northern Hemisphere
   sea surface temperatures of about 0.3 degrees C between about 1968 and
   1972. The timescale of the drop is shorter than that associated with
   either tropospheric aerosol loadings or previous characterizations of
   oscillatory multidecadal variability. The drop is evident in all
   available historical sea surface temperature data sets, is not traceable
   to changes in the attendant metadata, and is not linked to any known
   biases in surface temperature measurements. The drop is not concentrated
   in any discrete region of the Northern Hemisphere oceans, but its
   amplitude is largest over the northern North Atlantic.

   Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment/Fleet Numerical Meteorology and

   ICOADS and FNMOC are of the same origin as NCEP GTS. Quality control
   (QC) information is either unavailable (NCEP), not well documented
   (FNMOC), or nonuniform (ICOADS, FNMOC). Preliminary QC was implemented
   in this study and uniformly applied to all data sets. All analyses are
   stratified by major types of in situ platforms including ships,
   drifters, and moored buoys, the latter being further subdivided into
   tropical and coastal. Ships overwhelmingly prevailed before 1990 but
   then declined, whereas the number of drifters significantly increased,
   as did their reporting density. Although both platforms sample the full
   SST range well, drifters cover the global ocean much more uniformly than
   ships. Statistical analyses are performed on the in situ SST anomalies
   with respect to daily Reynolds and daily Pathfinder. Different global
   mean biases are observed for different platform types (e. g., similar
   to+0.03 K for drifters and tropical moorings and similar to+0.15 K for
   ships, with respect to Reynolds SST), suggesting existence of
   cross-platform biases that need to be reconciled. Root mean square (RMS)
   errors of the four types of in situ data have been estimated via
   three-way analyses proposed in O'Carroll et al. (2008). The geographical
   distributions of RMS errors in Pathfinder, Reynolds, and in situ SSTs
   show distinct spatial patterns, which require further understanding and
   remediation.

AB Surface temperature, salinity, and density are examined in the
   northeastern part of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre over the last 115
   years of measurements. This region presents coherent variability in
   space but also between different seasons, with relatively small trends
   and large multidecadal variability. The most significant trend is a
   lowering in surface density. Multidecadal variability in T and S is
   large and is usually similar, with the largest difference between the
   two in the 1920s and a tendency of T to lead S. Multidecadal T and S are
   correlated with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index at 0
   or 1-yr lag for T and 0 to 3-yr lag for S. This suggests a strong
   contribution of advection. The lag between T and S is also suggestive of
   a contribution of air-sea fluxes of heat or freshwater, but probably
   more so at high frequencies than at the multidecadal time scales.
   Salinity higher frequency is correlated with NAO at a 2-3-yr lag,
   whereas T higher frequency variability presents no correlation with NAO
   at any lag. This suggests different relations between seasonal NAO
   indices and air-sea heat fluxes patterns in this region before and after
   1960; also the advective signal is more clearly identified in salinity
   in this region.

AB Measurements of sea surface temperature (SST) are an important climate
   record, complementing terrestrial air temperature observations, records
   of marine air temperature, ocean subsurface temperature, and ocean heat
   content. SST has been measured since the 18th century, although
   observations are sparse in the early period. Historically, marine
   observing systems relied on observations made by seafarers and necessary
   information on measurement methods is often not available. There are
   many historical descriptions of observing practice and instrumentation,
   some including quantification of biases between different methods. This
   documentation has been used, with the available observations, to develop
   models for the expected biases, which vary according to how the
   measurements were made, over time and with the environmental conditions.
   Adjustments have been developed for these biases and some gridded SST
   datasets adjust for these differences and provide uncertainty estimates,
   including uncertainties in the bias adjustments. The modern in situ
   SST-observing system continues to evolve and now includes many
   observations from moored and drifting buoys, which must be characterized
   relative to earlier observations to provide a consistent record of
   multi-decadal changes in SST. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. WIREs

AB Sea ice extent and thickness may be affected by cloud changes, and sea
   ice changes may in turn impart changes to cloud cover. Different types
   of clouds have different effects on sea ice. Visual cloud reports from
   land and ocean regions of the Arctic are analyzed here for interannual
   variations of total cloud cover and nine cloud types, and their relation
   to sea ice.
   Over the high Arctic, cloud cover shows a distinct seasonal cycle
   dominated by low stratiform clouds, which are much more common in summer
   than winter. Interannual variations of cloud amounts over the Arctic
   Ocean show significant correlations with surface air temperature, total
   sea ice extent, and the Arctic Oscillation. Low ice extent in September
   is generally preceded by a summer with decreased middle and
   precipitating clouds. Following a low-ice September there is enhanced
   low cloud cover in autumn. Total cloud cover appears to be greater
   throughout the year during low-ice years.
   Multidecadal trends from surface observations over the Arctic Ocean show
   increasing cloud cover, which may promote ice loss by longwave radiative
   forcing. Trends are positive in all seasons, but are most significant
   during spring and autumn, when cloud cover is positively correlated with
   surface air temperature. The coverage of summertime precipitating clouds
   has been decreasing over the Arctic Ocean, which may promote ice loss.

AB Global sea level has risen during the past decades as a result of
   thermal expansion of the warming ocean and freshwater addition from
   melting continental ice(1). However, sea-level rise is not globally
   uniform(1-5). Regional sea levels can be affected by changes in
   atmospheric or oceanic circulation. As long-term observational records
   are scarce, regional changes in sea level in the Indian Ocean are poorly
   constrained. Yet estimates of future sea-level changes are essential for
   effective risk assessment(2). Here we combine in situ and satellite
   observations of Indian Ocean sea level with climate-model simulations,
   to identify a distinct spatial pattern of sea-level rise since the
   1960s. We find that sea level has decreased substantially in the south
   tropical Indian Ocean whereas it has increased elsewhere. This pattern
   is driven by changing surface winds associated with a combined
   invigoration of the Indian Ocean Hadley and Walker cells, patterns of
   atmospheric overturning circulation in the north-south and east-west
   direction, respectively, which is partly attributable to rising levels
   of atmospheric greenhouse gases. We conclude that-if ongoing
   anthropogenic warming dominates natural variability-the pattern we
   detected is likely to persist and to increase the environmental stress
   on some coasts and islands in the Indian Ocean.

   with some degree of autocorrelation, and cross-correlations between
   measuring sites and variables. Reference cell coding is used to
   investigate similarities in behaviour among sites. Parameter estimation
   is performed in a single modelling step, thereby producing more reliable
   credibility intervals than previous studies. This is of special
   importance in the assessment of trend significance. We employ a Bayesian
   approach with a purposely developed Markov chain Monte Carlo method to
   explore the posterior distribution of the parameters. Our results

AB Six different SST analyses are compared with each other and with buoy
   data for the period 2007-08. All analyses used different combinations of
   satellite data [for example, infrared Advanced Very High Resolution
   Radiometer (AVHRR) and microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer
   (AMSR) instruments] with different algorithms, spatial resolution, etc.
   The analyses considered are theNationalClimaticDataCenter (NCDC)
   AVHRR-only and AMSR + AVHRR, the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation
   (NCODA), the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), the Real-Time Global
   High-Resolution (RTG-HR), and the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis
   (OSTIA); the spatial grid sizes were 1/4 degrees, 1/4 degrees, 1/9
   degrees, 1/11 degrees, 1/12 degrees, and 1/20 degrees, respectively. In
   addition, all analyses except RSS used in situ data. Most analysis
   procedures and weighting functions differed. Thus, differences among
   analyses could be large in high-gradient and data-sparse regions. An
   example off the coast of South Carolina showed winter SST differences
   that exceeded 5 degrees C.
   To help quantify SST analysis differences, wavenumber spectra were
   computed at several locations. These results suggested that the RSS is
   much noisier and that the RTG-HR analysis is much smoother than the
   other analyses. Further comparisons made using collocated buoys showed
   that RSS was especially noisy in the tropics and that RTG-HRhad winter
   biases near the Aleutians region during January and February 2007. The
   correlation results show that NCODA and, to a somewhat lesser extent,
   OSTIA are strongly tuned locally to buoy data. The results also show
   that grid spacing does not always correlate with analysis resolution.
   The AVHRR-only analysis is useful for climate studies because it is the
   only daily SST analysis that extends back to September 1981.
   Furthermore, comparisons of the AVHRR-only analysis and the AMSR+AVHRR
   analysis show that AMSR data can degrade the combined AMSR and AVHRR
   resolution in cloud-free regions while AMSR otherwise improves the
   resolution. These results indicate that changes in satellite instruments
   over time can impact SST analysis resolution.

AB El Nino's influence on the subtropical northwest (NW) Pacific climate
   increased after the climate regime shift of the 1970s. This is
   manifested in well-organized atmospheric anomalies of suppressed
   convection and a surface anticyclone during the summer (June August) of
   the El Nino decay year [RAW], a season when equatorial Pacific sea
   surface temperature (SST) anomalies have dissipated. In situ
   observations and ocean atmospheric reanalyses are used to investigate
   mechanisms for the interdecadal change. During JJA(1), the influence of
   the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the NW Pacific is indirect,
   being mediated by SST conditions over the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO).
   The results here show that interdecadal change in this influence is due
   to changes in the TIO response to ENSO.
   During the postregime shift epoch, the El Nino teleconnection excites
   downwelling Rossby waves in the south 110 by anticyclonic wind curls.
   These Rossby waves propagate slowly westward, causing persistent SST
   warming over the thermocline ridge in the southwest TIO. The ocean
   warming induces an antisymmetric wind pattern across the equator, and
   the anomalous northeasterlies cause the north Indian Ocean to warm
   through JJA(1) by reducing the southwesterly monsoon winds. The TIO
   warming excites a warm Kelvin wave in tropospheric temperature,
   resulting in robust atmospheric anomalies over the NW Pacific that
   include the surface anticyclone. During the preregime shift epoch, ENSO
   is significantly weaker in variance and decays earlier than during the
   recent epoch. Compared to the epoch after the mid-1970s, SST and wind
   anomalies over the TIO are similar during the developing and mature
   phases of ENSO but are very weak during the decay phase. Specifically,
   the southern TIO Rossby waves are weaker, so are the antisymmetric wind
   pattern and the North Indian Ocean warming during JJA(1). Without the
   anchor in the TIO warming, atmospheric anomalies over the NW Pacific
   fail to develop during JJA(1) prior to the mid-1970s. The relationship
   of the interdecadal change to global warming and implications for the
   East Asian summer monsoon are discussed.

AB Local to regional climate anomalies are to a large extent determined by
   the state of the atmospheric circulation. The knowledge of large-scale
   sea level pressure (SLP) variations in former times is therefore crucial
   when addressing past climate changes across Europe and the
   Mediterranean. However, currently available SLP reconstructions lack
   data from the ocean, particularly in the pre-1850 period. Here we
   present a new statistically-derived 5A degrees A xA 5A degrees resolved
   gridded seasonal SLP dataset covering the eastern North Atlantic, Europe
   and the Mediterranean area (40A degrees W-50A degrees E; 20A degrees
   N-70A degrees N) back to 1750 using terrestrial instrumental pressure
   series and marine wind information from ship logbooks. For the period
   1750-1850, the new SLP reconstruction provides a more accurate
   representation of the strength of the winter westerlies as well as the
   location and variability of the Azores High than currently available
   multiproxy pressure field reconstructions. These findings strongly
   support the potential of ship logbooks as an important source to
   determine past circulation variations especially for the pre-1850
   period. This new dataset can be further used for dynamical studies
   relating large-scale atmospheric circulation to temperature and
   precipitation variability over the Mediterranean and Eurasia, for the
   comparison with outputs from GCMs as well as for detection and
   attribution studies.

AB Regional interdecadal variability, on subbasin to basin scales, is shown
   to be a robust feature of the post-World War II (WWII) historical
   temperature record, even after a recently proposed bias correction to
   XBT fall rates is applied. This study shows that the previously reported
   strong regional variability is generally unaffected by this correction,
   even though the interdecadal variability in the most recently published
   estimates of global ocean heat content is much reduced after a
   correction is applied. Following methods used in previous trend analysis
   work, estimates of interdecadal trends are calculated for individual
   regions of the global ocean where there are sufficient data. Spatial
   maps of temperature trends for the surface and three subsurface depths
   (50, 100, and 300 m) are presented, with both bias-corrected and
   uncorrected data trends at 100 and 300 m shown for comparison. In the
   upper two depths and at the surface, interdecadal variability is shown
   to be present and strong in most of the analysis regions. At 100 m, the
   differences between trends based on bias-corrected versus uncorrected
   data are small, and barely distinguishable for much of the ocean
   analyzed. There are more differences at 300 m between the two data
   treatments, but large-scale patterns are still present in the
   bias-corrected trends, especially where the trends are stronger.
   Given the sampling issues discussed in previous works, the presence of
   strong interdecadal variability on smaller scales raises concerns that
   global interdecadal variability in the historical record still may not
   be properly resolved.

   that of the global CO(2) concentration. Both trends were small prior to
   the end of the 19th century; after that, trends became clear, more so
   from the 1960s to the 1990s (the end of the coral record). The overall
   coral density shows a steady decrease from the late 19th century to the

AB Records of Atlantic basin tropical cyclones (TCs) since the late
   nineteenth century indicate a very large upward trend in storm
   frequency. This increase in documented TCs has been previously
   interpreted as resulting from anthropogenic climate change. However,
   improvements in observing and recording practices provide an alternative
   interpretation for these changes: recent studies suggest that the number
   of potentially missed TCs is sufficient to explain a large part of the
   recorded increase in TC counts. This study explores the influence of
   another factor-TC duration-on observed changes in TC frequency, using a
   widely used Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT). It is found that the
   occurrence of short-lived storms (duration of 2 days or less) in the
   database has increased dramatically, from less than one per year in the
   late nineteenth-early twentieth century to about five per year since
   about 2000, while medium-to long-lived storms have increased little, if
   at all. Thus, the previously documented increase in total TC frequency
   since the late nineteenth century in the database is primarily due to an
   increase in very short-lived TCs.
   The authors also undertake a sampling study based upon the distribution
   of ship observations, which provides quantitative estimates of the
   frequency of missed TCs, focusing just on the moderate to long-lived
   systems with durations exceeding 2 days in the raw HURDAT. Upon adding
   the estimated numbers of missed TCs, the time series of moderate to
   long-lived Atlantic TCs show substantial multidecadal variability, but
   neither time series exhibits a significant trend since the late
   nineteenth century, with a nominal decrease in the adjusted time series.
   Thus, to understand the source of the century-scale increase in Atlantic
   TC counts in HURDAT, one must explain the relatively monotonic increase
   in very short-duration storms since the late nineteenth century. While
   it is possible that the recorded increase in short-duration TCs
   represents a real climate signal, the authors consider that it is more
   plausible that the increase arises primarily from improvements in the
   quantity and quality of observations, along with enhanced interpretation
   techniques. These have allowed National Hurricane Center forecasters to
   better monitor and detect initial TC formation, and thus incorporate
   increasing numbers of very short-lived systems into the TC database.

   comparable to warming rates for the Arctic and Labrador, the source of
   coastal ocean waters north of Cape Hatteras (36 degrees N). South of
   Cape Hatteras, coastal ocean temperature trends match the regional
   atmospheric temperature trend. The observations and a simple model show
   that along-shelf transport, associated with the mean coastal current
   system running from Labrador to Cape Hatteras, is the mechanism
   controlling long-term temperature changes for this region and not the

AB The present study provides a consistent and unified solution for the two
   types of thermodynamical coupled modes in the atmosphere-ocean climate
   system: the tropical meridional mode and the subtropical dipole mode.
   The solution is derived analytically from a linear model that couples a
   simple atmosphere to a slab ocean via the wind-evaporation-SST (WES)
   feedback. For a mean zonal wind, the results show that the wind (hence
   latent heat flux) anomaly and the SST anomaly differ in phase such that
   the tropical mode propagates downwind and the subtropical modes
   propagate upwind, with both modes being damped by the SST-driven
   component of latent heat flux. Despite the existence of positive WES
   feedback, the large-scale subtropical modes are always stable, while the
   tropical mode can become unstable only when the air-sea coupling is
   strong and the mean wind is easterly. Furthermore, the mean meridional
   winds break the equatorial symmetry and enable the coupled modes to
   intensify in the Southern (Northern) Hemisphere for a southerly
   (northerly) component. For realistic parameter values, these
   thermodynamical coupled modes have periods and damping time scales in
   years; hence, they may play important roles in the tropical
   interannual-to-decadal climate variability.

AB An important question in assessing twentieth-century climate change is
   to what extent have ENSO-related variations contributed to the observed
   trends. Isolating such contributions is challenging for several reasons,
   including ambiguities arising from how ENSO itself is defined. In
   particular, defining ENSO in terms of a single index and ENSO-related
   variations in terms of regressions on that index, as done in many
   previous studies, can lead to wrong conclusions. This paper argues that
   ENSO is best viewed not as a number but as an evolving dynamical process
   for this purpose. Specifically, ENSO is identified with the four
   dynamical eigenvectors of tropical SST evolution that are most important
   in the observed evolution of ENSO events. This definition is used to
   isolate the ENSO-related component of global SST variations on a
   month-by-month basis in the 136-yr (1871-2006) Hadley Centre Sea Ice and
   Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST). The analysis shows that
   previously identified multidecadal variations in the Pacific. Indian,
   and Atlantic Oceans all have substantial ENSO components. The long-term
   warming trends over these oceans are also found to have appreciable ENSO
   components, in sonic instances up to 40% of the total trend. The
   ENSO-unrelated component of 5-yr average SST variations, obtained by
   removing the ENSO-related component, is interpreted as a combination of
   anthropogenic, naturally forced, and internally generated coherent
   multidecadal variations. The following two surprising aspects of these
   ENSO-unrelated variations are emphasized: 1) a strong cooling trend in
   the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and 2) a nearly zonally symmetric
   multidecadal tropical-extratropical seesaw that has amplified in recent
   decades. The latter has played a major role in modulating SSTs over the
   Indian Ocean.

AB The double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) over the tropical
   Pacific, with a spurious band of maximum annual sea surface temperature
   (SST) south of the equator between 5 degrees S and 10 degrees S, is a
   chronic bias in coupled ocean-atmosphere models. This study focuses on a
   region of the double ITCZ in the central Pacific from 5 degrees S to 10
   degrees S and 170 degrees E to 150 degrees W, where coupled models
   display the largest biases in precipitation, by deriving a best estimate
   of the mixed layer heat budget for the region. Seven global datasets of
   objectively analyzed surface energy fluxes and four ocean assimilation
   products are first compared and then evaluated against field
   measurements in adjacent regions. It was shown that the global datasets
   differ greatly in their net downward surface energy flux in this region,
   but they fall broadly into two categories: one with net downward heat
   flux of about 30 W m(-2) and the other around 10 W m (2). Measurements
   from the adjacent Manus and Nauru sites of the Atmospheric Radiation
   Measurement Program (ARM), the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) buoys,
   and the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere
   Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) are then used to show that the smaller
   value is more realistic. An energy balance of the mixed layer is finally
   presented for the region as primarily between warming from surface heat
   flux of 7 W m(-2) and horizontal advective cooling in the zonal
   direction of about 5 W m(-2), with secondary contributions from
   meridional and vertical advections, heat storage, and subgrid-scale
   mixing. The 7 W m(-2) net surface heat flux consists of warming of 210 W
   m(-2) from solar radiation and cooling of 53, 141, and 8 W m(-2).
   respectively, from longwave radiation, latent heat flux, and sensible
   heat flux. These values provide an observational basis to further study
   the initial development of excessive precipitation in coupled climate
   models in the central Pacific.

   this warming but, as a whole, it is mostly distinct in the upper 100 m
   layer both in the tropics and midlatitudes. For the first time, the

AB Repeating the history of study on El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in
   the 1980s, interdecadal oscillation (IDO) in climate variability is
   currently an area of active research and debate, following the
   recognition of its emerging significance in nature and science. In this
   work, a two-dimensional propagating modal extraction technique is
   applied to a reconstructed global monthly sea surface temperature (SST)
   data set spanning 1854 through 2007, to examine the spatiotemporal
   structure of SST variability with an emphasis on the fine modal pattern
   of IDOs. In the time domain, it is revealed that a canonical modal
   spectrum of decadal-to-centennial SST variability constitutes four most
   distinct oscillations with periodicities at 9.0, 13.0, 21.2, and 62.2
   years, which are naturally defined as primary modes and are,
   respectively, termed as the subdecadal mode, the quasidecadal mode, the
   interdecadal mode, and the multidecadal mode (modes S, Q, I, and M).
   They join the energetic annual mode (mode A) and two major ENSO modes at
   3.7 and 5.8 years (modes B and C), as well as a dozen of secondary modes
   ranging from semiannual to multidecadal, in determining the key pattern
   of SST-related climate variability. In the space domain, seven modally
   dynamic areas, analogous to the Nino regions for ENSO, are clearly
   identified and are named as IDO zones. Contrary to ENSO, dominant IDO
   zones are most visible in the extratropical oceans, especially in the
   North Atlantic/North Pacific sectors, while secondary signatures are
   observed in the tropical oceans. The array of (four) primary modes with
   respect to (seven) major zones yields a sophisticated yet canonical
   pattern of IDOs, leading to a basic conclusion that multimodality (for a
   given region) and multiregionality (for a given mode) are fundamental
   features of the IDO system.

AB Historical ship observations of sea surface temperature (SST) from 1850
   to present were used to compute linear 40-yr trends for all 5 degrees
   latitude by 5 degrees longitude grid cells with sufficient data. Trends
   from throughout the twentieth century were centered about a 7 mK yr(-1)
   warming trend with standard deviation 14 mK yr(-1). Although different
   with high statistical significance from a distribution with zero mean,
   the warming trends were not unusual in amplitude compared to the
   available nineteenth-century trends. Trends at the same grid points from
   the latter half of the nineteenth century were distributed about
   near-zero mean with standard deviation 17 mK yr-1. The shift in mean is
   robust to accounting for the biases arising from differing observational
   methods prior to 1942. The 40-yr trends from the latter half of the
   twentieth century were centered about 10 +/- 4 mK yr(-1) and more
   clearly distinct from earlier trends. Linear 40-yr trends were computed
   at different locations and times from all publicly available coral
   skeleton records of the concentration ratio of Sr to ca. The
   pre-twentieth-century distribution of 40-yr trends in the Sr/Ca ratio
   was significantly different from the twentieth-century trends,
   consistent with the warming found in the instrumental SST. The
   interpretation of the coral Sr/Ca 40-yr trends cannot yet be reduced to
   a single factor. Major uncertainties were due to (i) the correlation of
   modern Sr/Ca records with instrumental SST being dominated by seasonal
   effects, with correlations on time scales longer than the annual cycle
   much lower, and (ii) the poor quality instrumental SST on long time
   scales in remote locations. Based on the NOAA extended reconstructed
   instrumental SST dataset since 1870 and 499 yr of Sr/Ca data from 13
   different coral records, the authors found a Pearson correlation
   coefficient r = -0.77 for 40-yr low-pass-filtered times series.
   Interpreting the change in distribution of trends in Sr/Ca will require
   further study of the factors affecting Sr/Ca on time scales longer than
   seasonal.

AB An observational analysis of Mediterranean Sea water cycle variability
   based on recently available datasets provides new insights on the
   long-term changes that affected the region since the 1960s. Results
   indicate an overall increase in evaporation during 1958-2006, with a
   decrease up until the mid-1970s and an increase thereafter.
   Precipitation variability is characterized by substantial interdecadal
   variations and a negative long-term trend. Evaporation increase,
   primarily driven by SST variability, together with precipitation
   decrease resulted in a substantial increase in the loss of freshwater
   from the Mediterranean Sea toward the overlying atmosphere. An increase
   in the freshwater deficit is consistent with observed Mediterranean Sea
   salinity tendencies and has broad implications for the Mediterranean
   water cycle and connected systems.
   These observational results are in qualitative agreement with simulated
   Mediterranean Sea water cycle behavior from a large ensemble of models
   from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3). However,
   simulated anomalies are about one order of magnitude smaller than those
   observed. This inconsistency and the large uncertainties associated with
   the observational rates of change highlight the need for more research
   to better characterize and understand Mediterranean water cycle
   variations in recent decades, and to better simulate the crucial
   underlying processes in global models.

AB El Nino and La Nina comprise the dominant mode of tropical climate
   variability: the El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.
   ENSO variations influence climate, ecosystems, and societies around the
   globe. It is, therefore, of great interest to understand the character
   of past and future ENSO variations. In this brief review, we explore our
   current understanding of these issues. The amplitude and character of
   ENSO have been observed to exhibit substantial variations on timescales
   of decades to centuries; many of these changes over the past millennium
   resemble those that arise from internally generated climate variations
   in an unforced climate model. ENSO activity and characteristics have
   been found to depend on the state of the tropical Pacific climate
   system, which is expected to change in the 21st century in response to
   changes in radiative forcing (including increased greenhouse gases) and
   internal climate variability. However, the extent and character of the
   response of ENSO to increased in greenhouse gases are still a topic of
   considerable research, and given the results published to date, we
   cannot yet rule out possibilities of an increase, decrease, or no change
   in ENSO activity arising from increases in CO2. Yet we are fairly
   confident that ENSO variations will continue to occur and influence
   global climate in the coming decades and centuries. Changes in
   continental climate, however, could alter the remote impacts of El Nino
   and La Nina. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. WIREs Clim Change 2010 1

AB Evidence is presented of a reduction in relative humidity over

   leading up to 2008, based on monthly anomalies in surface air
   temperature and humidity from comprehensive European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalyses (ERA-40 and ERA-Interim) and
   from Climatic Research Unit and Hadley Centre analyses of monthly
   station temperature data (CRUTEM3) and synoptic humidity observations
   (HadCRUH). The data sets agree well for both temperature and humidity
   variations for periods and places of overlap, although the average
   warming over land is larger for the fully sampled ERA data than for the
   spatially and temporally incomplete CRUTEM3 data. Near-surface specific
   humidity varies similarly over land and sea, suggesting that the recent
   reduction in relative humidity over land may be due to limited moisture
   supply from the oceans, where evaporation has been limited by sea
   surface temperatures that have not risen in concert with temperatures
   over land. Continental precipitation from the reanalyses is compared
   with a new gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)
   data set, with the combined gauge and satellite products of the Global
   Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and the Climate Prediction
   Center (CPC), Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), and with CPC's
   independent gauge analysis of precipitation over land (PREC/L). The
   reanalyses agree best with the new GPCC and latest GPCP data sets, with
   ERA-Interim significantly better than ERA-40 at capturing monthly
   variability. Shifts over time in the differences among the precipitation
   data sets make it difficult to assess their longer-term variations and
   any link with longer-term variations in humidity.

AB A simple method of interpolating sea-surface temperature (SST) and its
   measurement method is applied to western North Pacific ship and buoy
   observations taken between 1970 and 2000. Comparisons are made between
   the resulting quasidaily in situ analyses and more inclusive analyses
   based mainly on satellite infrared observations. In terms of analysis
   differences, spatial correlation, and temporal spectra, the in situ
   analyses are found to be of moderate quality and are taken to be
   appropriate for composite diagnoses. This use is illustrated in a novel
   comparison of short-time-scale SST changes observed during the passage
   of two groups of midlatitude cold-season cyclones.
   Transient cooling is found to be preferentially associated with the
   stronger of the two cyclone groups. The significance of this cooling is
   quantified and the possibility of oceanic mixed-layer cooling and heat
   loss from bucket observations is explored. Although the bias in bucket
   observations is confirmed using composites constructed without such
   observations, the signature of transient cooling is still apparent.
   (Independent bucket observations also permit composite analysis errors
   to be estimated.) Engine intake observations are then identified as a
   primary source of both SST information in general and of the transient
   cooling signal in particular. A related bias in this type of observation
   is proposed. Greater sophistication in the analysis of in situ
   observations is also briefly discussed. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal

AB Sea fog is frequently observed over the Yellow Sea, with an average of
   50 fog days on the Chinese coast during April-July. The Yellow Sea fog
   season is characterized by an abrupt onset in April in the southern
   coast of Shandong Peninsula and an abrupt, basin-wide termination in
   August. This study investigates the mechanisms for such steplike
   evolution that is inexplicable from the gradual change in solar
   radiation. From March to April over the northwestern Yellow Sea, a
   temperature inversion forms in a layer 100-350 m above the sea surface,
   and the prevailing surface winds switch from northwesterly to southerly,
   both changes that are favorable for advection fog. The land-sea contrast
   is the key to these changes. In April, the land warms up much faster
   than the ocean. The prevailing west-southwesterlies at 925 hPa advect
   warm continental air to form an inversion over the western Yellow Sea.
   The land-sea differential warming also leads to the formation of a
   shallow anticyclone over the cool Yellow and northern East China Seas in
   April. The southerlies on the west flank of this anticyclone advect warm
   and humid air from the south, causing the abrupt fog onset on the
   Chinese coast. The lack of such warm/moist advection on the east flank
   of the anticyclone leads to a gradual increase in fog occurrence on the
   Korean coast. The retreat of Yellow Sea fog is associated with a shift
   in the prevailing winds from southerly to easterly from July to August.
   The August wind shift over the Yellow Sea is part of a large-scale
   change in the East Asian-western Pacific monsoons, characterized by
   enhanced convection over the subtropical northwest Pacific and the
   resultant teleconnection into the midlatitudes, the latter known as the
   western Pacific-Japan pattern. Back trajectories for foggy and fog-free
   air masses support the results from the climatological analysis.

AB Global-mean surface temperature is affected by both natural variability
   and anthropogenic forcing. This study is concerned with identifying and
   removing from global-mean temperatures the signatures of natural climate
   variability over the period January 1900-March 2009. A series of simple,
   physically based methodologies are developed and applied to isolate the
   climate impacts of three known sources of natural variability: the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), variations in the advection of marine
   air masses over the high-latitude continents during winter, and aerosols
   injected into the stratosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions. After
   the effects of ENSO and high-latitude temperature advection are removed
   from the global-mean temperature record, the signatures of volcanic
   eruptions and changes in instrumentation become more clearly apparent.
   After the volcanic eruptions are subsequently filtered from the record,
   the residual time series reveals a nearly monotonic global warming
   pattern since similar to 1950. The results also reveal coupling between
   the land and ocean areas on the interannual time scale that transcends

AB The present study is conducted to verify the short-range forecasts from
   mesoscale model version5 (MM5)/weather research and forecasting (WRF)
   model over the Indian region and to examine the impact of assimilation
   of quick scatterometer (QSCAT) near surface winds, spectral sensor
   microwave imager (SSM/I) wind speed and total precipitable water (TPW)
   on the forecasts by these models using their three-dimensional
   variational (3D-Var) data assimilation scheme for a 1-month period
   during July 2006. The control (without satellite data assimilation) as
   well as 3D-Var sensitivity experiments (with assimilating satellite
   data) using MM5/WRF were made for 48 h starting daily at 0000 UTC July
   2006. The control run is analyzed for the intercomparison of MM5/WRF
   short-range forecasts and is also used as a baseline for assessing the
   MM5/WRF 3D-Var satellite data sensitivity experiments. As compared to
   the observation, the MM5 (WRF) control simulations strengthened
   (weakened) the cross equatorial flow over southern Arabian sea near
   peninsular India. The forecasts from MM5 and WRF showed a warm and moist
   bias at lower and upper levels with a cold bias at the middle level,
   which shows that the convective schemes of these models may be too
   active during the simulation. The forecast errors in predicted wind,
   temperature and humidity at different levels are lesser in WRF as
   compared to MM5, except the temperature prediction at lower level. The
   rainfall pattern and prediction skill from day 1 and day 2 forecasts by
   WRF is superior to MM5. The spatial distribution of forecast impact for
   wind, temperature, and humidity from 1-month assimilation experiments
   during July 2006 demonstrated that on average, for 24 and 48-h
   forecasts, the satellite data improved the MM5/WRF initial condition, so
   that model errors in predicted meteorological fields got reduced. Among
   the experiments, MM5/WRF wind speed prediction is most benefited from
   QSCAT surface wind and SSM/I TPW assimilation while temperature and
   humidity prediction is mostly improved due to latter. The largest
   improvement in MM5/WRF rainfall prediction is due to the assimilation of
   SSM/I TPW. The assimilation of SSM/I wind speed alone in MM5/WRF
   degraded the humidity and rainfall prediction. In summary the
   assimilation of satellite data showed similar impact on MM5/WRF
   prediction; largest improvement due to SSM/I TPW and degradation due to
   SSM/I wind speed.

AB Weekly average satellite-based estimates of latent heat flux (LHTFL) are
   used to characterize spatial patterns and temporal variability in the
   intraseasonal band (periods shorter than 3 months). As expected, the
   major portion of intraseasonal variability of LHTFL is due to winds, but
   spatial variability of humidity and SST are also important. The
   strongest intraseasonal variability of LHTFL is observed at the
   midlatitudes. It weakens toward the equator, reflecting weak variance of
   intraseasonal winds at low latitudes. It also decreases at high
   latitudes, reflecting the effect of decreased SST and the related
   decrease of time-mean humidity difference between heights z = 10 m and z
   = 0 m. Within the midlatitude belts the intraseasonal variability of
   LHTFL is locally stronger (up to 50 W m(-2)) in regions of major SST
   fronts (like the Gulf Stream and Agulhas). Here it is forced by passing
   storms and is locally amplified by unstable air over warm SSTs. Although
   weaker in amplitude (but still significant), intraseasonal variability
   of LHTFL is observed in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans due to
   wind and humidity perturbations produced by the Madden-Julian
   oscillations. In this tropical region intraseasonal LHTFL and incoming
   solar radiation vary out of phase so that evaporation increases just
   below the convective clusters.
   Over much of the interior ocean where the surface heat flux dominates
   the ocean mixed layer heat budget, intraseasonal SST cools in response
   to anomalously strong upward intraseasonal LHTFL. This response varies
   geographically, in part because of geographic variations of mixed layer
   depth and the resulting variations in thermal inertia. In contrast, in
   the eastern tropical Pacific and Atlantic cold tongue regions
   intraseasonal SST and LHTFL are positively correlated. This surprising
   result occurs because in these equatorial upwelling areas SST is
   controlled by advection rather than by surface fluxes. Here LHTFL
   responds to rather than drives SST.

AB A suite of shipboard and satellite observations are analyzed and
   synthesized to investigate the three-dimensional structure of clouds and
   influences from sea surface temperature fronts over the western North
   Pacific. Sharp transitions are observed across the Kuroshio Extension
   (KE) front in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) and its
   clouds. The ocean's influence appears to extend beyond the MABL, with
   higher cloud tops in altitude along the KE front than the surroundings.
   In winter, intense turbulent heat release from the ocean takes place on
   the southern flank of the KE front, where the cloud top penetrates above
   the MABL and reaches the midtroposphere. In this band of high cloud
   tops, frequent lightning activity is observed. The results of this study
   suggest a sea level pressure mechanism for which the temperature
   gradient in the MABL induces strong surface wind convergence on the
   southern flank of the KE front, deepening the clouds there.
   In early summer, sea fog frequently occurs on the northern flank of the
   subtropical KE and subarctic fronts under southerly warm advection that
   suppresses surface heat flux and stabilizes the surface atmosphere. Sea
   fog is infrequently observed over the KE front even under southerly
   conditions, as the warm ocean current weakens atmospheric stratification
   and promotes vertical mixing. The KE front produces a narrow band of
   surface wind convergence, helping support a broad band of upward motion
   at 700 hPa that is associated with the eastward extension of the baiu
   rainband from Japan in June-July.

AB Feedbacks involving low-level clouds remain a primary cause of
   uncertainty in global climate model projections. This issue was
   addressed by examining changes in low-level clouds over the Northeast
   Pacific in observations and climate models. Decadal fluctuations were
   identified in multiple, independent cloud data sets, and changes in
   cloud cover appeared to be linked to changes in both local temperature
   structure and large-scale circulation. This observational analysis
   further indicated that clouds act as a positive feedback in this region
   on decadal time scales. The observed relationships between cloud cover
   and regional meteorological conditions provide a more complete way of
   testing the realism of the cloud simulation in current-generation
   climate models. The only model that passed this test simulated a
   reduction in cloud cover over much of the Pacific when greenhouse gases
   were increased, providing modeling evidence for a positive low-level
   cloud feedback.

AB Ocean tide is a periodic phenomenon of the rise and fall of the sea
   level that depends on the bathymetry and positions of the moon and sun
   relative to the earth. In the Okhotsk Sea, the ocean tide causes strong
   vertical mixing in the upper ocean, generating rich structures in summer
   SST with extraordinarily cold patches on Kashevarov Bank, along the
   Kuril Islands, northeast of the Terpeniya Peninsula, and inside
   Shelikhov Bay. The present study analyzes and synthesizes a suite of
   ship-board and satellite observations, and numerical simulations to
   investigate the ocean tidal cooling effect on summer sea fog over the
   Okhotsk Sea. Over the tide-induced cold patches, atmospheric stability
   increases, and surface wind weakens markedly possibly through suppressed
   atmospheric vertical mixing. Our analysis of ship-board observations
   reveals frequent sea-fog occurrence over the cold patches with a maximum
   exceeding 70% along the Kuril Islands in July-August. Numerical
   simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model
   support that the cold patches cool air temperature, decelerate surface
   wind, and form a strong surface inversion layer up to 0.5 km high,
   creating favorable conditions for sea-fog occurrence. The WRF simulation
   without the tidal cooling effect reduces sea-fog occurrence by more than
   20% over cold patches, illustrating the importance of SST products for
   climate models.

AB Correlation analyses, linear regression models, and multistock mixed
   effects models were used to examine the relationships between coho
   salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch marine survival and six biological and
   environmental covariates across 14 southeast Alaska (SEAK) stocks. A
   primary focus of the study was to investigate the influence of pink
   salmon O. gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta fry abundances on coho
   salmon marine survival. The coho salmon stocks exhibited strong
   covariation; 88 of the 91 pairwise comparisons among the coho salmon
   stocks covaried positively and 54 of them were significant (P < 0.05).
   Only one of the covariates, the North Pacific index, which is a measure
   of the Aleutian low pressure zone, had consistent relationships
   (positive) across all 14 stocks. The other covariates, including
   freshwater discharge, the Pacific decadal oscillation, sea-surface
   temperature, and two indices of pink salmon and chum salmon fry
   abundances, all had inconsistent relationships with marine survival. The
   best-fit linear regression models varied greatly among the 14 stocks, as
   did the R(2) values, which ranged from 0.00 to 0.54. An index
   representing local hatchery pink salmon and chum salmon fry abundance
   was the most important variable in explaining the variation in marine
   survival, having a stronger estimated effect on survival than an index
   of local wild pink salmon fry abundance. The magnitude and sign of the
   hatchery pink salmon and chum salmon effect varied greatly among
   different localities. Our results suggest that (1) SEAK coho salmon
   stocks are not equally influenced by the same factors and (2) there are
   factors that appear to affect marine survival of SEAK coho salmon stocks
   at varying spatial scales. This study also provides evidence that coho
   salmon stocks throughout SEAK experience some degree of regional
   concordance in the marine environment but also that local stock-specific
   conditions are important in fully understanding variation in marine
   survival.

AB Ongoing climate variations in the Arctic and Antarctic pose an apparent
   paradox. In contrast to the large warming and loss of sea ice in the
   Arctic in recent decades, Antarctic temperatures and sea ice show little
   change except for the Antarctic Peninsula. However, model simulations
   indicate that the Arctic changes have been shaped largely by
   low-frequency variations of the atmospheric circulation, superimposed on
   a greenhouse wan-ning that is apparent in model simulations when
   ensemble averages smooth out the circulation-driven variability of the
   late 20th century. By contrast, the Antarctic changes of recent decades
   appear to be shaped by ozone depletion and an associated strengthening
   of the Southern annular mode of the atmospheric circulation. While the
   signature of greenhouse-driven change is projected to emerge from the
   natural variability during the present century, the emergence of a
   statistically significant greenhouse signal may be slower than in other
   regions. Models Suggest that feedbacks from retreating sea ice will make
   autumn and winter the seasons of the earliest emergence of the
   greenhouse signal in both Polar Regions. Priorities for enhanced
   robustness of the Antarctic climate simulations are the inclusion of
   ozone chemistry and the realistic simulation of water vapour over the
   Antarctic Ice Sheet.

AB The exchange, or flux, of heat between the oceans and atmosphere is an
   important driver of the global oceanic and atmospheric circulations but
   remains poorly quantified. Direct measurement of heat flux remains a
   research activity and so global heat flux datasets are generated using
   observations of winds, air and sea temperatures, and humidity as input
   to heat flux parameterizations known as "bulk formulas." We remain
   dependent on the observations from merchant ships in the Voluntary
   Observing Ships (VOS) program, which are archived in the International
   Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS); measurements from buoys
   are sparse and satellites cannot accurately recover all the variables
   required for heat flux calculation.
   Careful analysis of VOS data is necessary to produce gridded data-sets
   of meteorological variables and fluxes with the accuracy required for
   climate research. Past in situ flux datasets have averaged observations
   on monthly timescales to reduce random uncertainty. It has therefore
   been hard to understand the contributions to observed variability from
   measurement errors, poor sampling, or natural variability. The new
   dataset, which covers the period 1973 to 2006, avoids this problem by
   first constructing daily mean fields using optimal interpolation. This
   allows each component of variability to be handled correctly and, for
   the first time, uncertainty estimates to be produced. New bias
   adjustments have also been developed and applied. The new dataset is
   described and a preliminary comparison with flux estimates from moored
   buoys, satellites, and atmospheric reanalysis models is presented.

AB Marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds can significantly regulate the
   sensitivity of climate models, yet they are currently poorly simulated.
   This study aims to characterize the seasonal variations of physical
   properties of these clouds and their associated processes by using
   multisatellite data. Measurements from several independent satellite
   datasets [ International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP),
   Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System-Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (CERES-MODIS), Geoscience Laser Altimeter System
   (GLAS), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite
   Observation (CALIPSO)], in conjunction with balloon soundings from the
   mobile facility of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement ( ARM) program
   at Point Reyes and reanalysis products, are used to characterize the
   seasonal variations of MBL cloud-top and cloud-base heights, cloud
   thickness, the degree of decoupling between clouds and MBL, and
   inversion strength off the California coast.
   The main results from this study are as follows: (i) MBL clouds over the
   northeast subtropical Pacific in the summer are more prevalent and
   associated with a larger in-cloud water path than in winter. The
   cloud-top and cloud-base heights are lower in the summer than in the
   winter. (ii) Although the lower-tropospheric stability of the atmosphere
   is higher in the summer, the MBL inversion strength is only weakly
   stronger in the summer because of a negative feedback from the cloud-top
   altitude. Summertime MBL clouds are more homogeneous and are associated
   with lower surface latent heat flux than those in the winter. (iii)
   Seasonal variations of low-cloud properties from summer to winter
   resemble the downstream stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition of MBL
   clouds in terms of MBL depth, cloud-top and cloud-base heights,
   inversion strength, and spatial homogeneity. The "deepening-warming''
   mechanism of Bretherton and Wyant for the stratocumulus-to-trade-cumulus
   transition downstream of the cold eastern ocean can also explain the
   seasonal variation of low clouds from the summer to the winter, except
   that warming of the sea surface temperature needs to be taken as
   relative to the free-tropospheric air temperature, which occurs in the
   winter. The observed variation of low clouds from summer to winter is
   attributed to the much larger seasonal cooling of the free-tropospheric
   air temperature than that of the sea surface temperature.

AB Surface "swarms" of the swimming crabs Charybdis smithii are still
   considered as an unusual phenomenon in the open Indian Ocean, although
   their dense pelagic aggregations were already reported in waters off the
   Indian coast and in the northern Arabian Sea. Based on an extensive
   large-scale data series taken over 45 years, we demonstrate that C.
   smithii is common in the pelagic provinces of the western Indian Ocean
   driven by the wind monsoon regime. Swimming crabs are dispersed by the
   monsoon currents throughout the equatorial Indian Ocean. They aggregate
   at night in the upper 150-m layer, where their estimated biomass derived
   from pelagic trawling data can exceed 130 kg km(-2). Abundance of C.
   smithii can reach > 15,000 ind. km(-2) in July (i.e. the peak of the
   south-west monsoon), declines by 50-fold in March and is negligible in
   May. C. smithii is an important prey for more than 30 species of
   abundant epipelagic top predators. In turn, it feeds on mesopelagic
   species. This swimming crab is a major species of the intermediate
   trophic levels and represents a crucial seasonal trophic link in the
   open ocean ecosystem of the western Indian Ocean. Outbursts in pelagic
   waters of huge biomasses of ordinarily benthic crustaceans (C. smithii
   and Natosquilla investigatoris) are a remarkable feature of the Indian
   Ocean, although similar, but smaller, events are reported in the Pacific
   and Atlantic Oceans.

   from 1867 to 1910; warming from 1910 to 1945; cooling from 1945 to 1974;
   and warming from 1974 to nowadays. Warming rates of 0.17 and 0.22
   degrees C per decade were measured during the warming sub-periods and
   cooling rates of -0.14 and -0.10 degrees C per decade were measured
   during the cooling sub-periods. The present warming period is on the
   same order of magnitude although slightly more intense than the one
   observed from 1910 to 1945, which is consistent with previous analysis
   carried for the North Atlantic. Finally, the thermal amplitude defined
   as the difference between the maximum and minimum annual values has
   increased since 1974 at a rate of 0.06 degrees C per decade due to the
   different increasing rates of the maximum (0.26 degrees C per decade)
   and minimum (0.20 degrees C per decade) SSTs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The surface circulation of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico is
   studied using 13 years of satellite altimetry data. Variability in the
   Caribbean Sea is evident over several time scales. At the annual scale,
   sea surface height (SSH) varies mainly by a seasonal steric effect.
   Interannually, a longer cycle affects the SSH slope across the current
   and hence the intensity of the Caribbean Current. This cycle is found to
   be related to changes in the wind intensity, the wind stress curl, and
   El Nino-Southern Oscillation. At shorter time scales, eddies and
   meanders are observed in the Caribbean Current, and their propagation
   speed is explained by baroclinic instabilities under the combined effect
   of vertical shear and the beta effect. Then the Loop Current (LC) is
   considered, focusing on the anticyclonic eddies shed by it and the
   intrusion of the LC into the Gulf of Mexico through time. Twelve of the
   21 anticyclonic eddies observed to detach from the LC are shed from July
   to September, suggesting a seasonality in the timing of these events.
   Also, a relation is found between the intrusion of the LC into the Gulf
   of Mexico and the size of the eddies shed from it: larger intrusions
   trigger smaller eddies. A series of extreme LC intrusions into the Gulf
   of Mexico, when the LC is observed as far as 92 degrees W, are
   described. The analyses herein suggest that the frequency of such events
   has increased in recent years, with only one event occurring in 1993
   versus three from 2002 to 2006. Transport through the Straits of Florida
   appears to decrease during these extreme intrusions.

AB The frequency of precipitation occurrence over the global oceans from
   2006 - 2007 as calculated from CloudSat radar data is compared to
   ship-based (ICOADS) and island-based (GSOD) data. It is shown that the
   spatial pattern of the precipitation frequency from CloudSat is
   consistent with previous climatological studies. The comparison to
   ship-based data reveal that CloudSat results are consistent with ship
   observations well into the high latitudes and appear to capture the
   seasonal cycle of precipitation well. A comparison to island data also
   shows good qualitative agreement, although the spatial scale mismatch
   complicates the efficacy of such comparisons. Nevertheless, CloudSat is
   shown to be a viable platform for obtaining quality satellite-based
   precipitation frequency measurements. Citation: Ellis, T. D., T.

AB Weather observations are vital for climate change monitoring and
   prediction. For the world's oceans, there are many meteorological and
   oceanographic observations available back to the mid-twentieth century,
   but coverage is limited in earlier periods, and particularly also during
   the two world wars. Before 1850 there are currently very few
   instrumental observations available. Consequently, detailed
   observational estimates of surface climate change can be made only back
   to the mid-nineteenth century. To improve and extend this early
   coverage, scientists need more observations from these periods.
   Fortunately, many such observations exist in logbooks, reports, and
   other paper records, but their inclusion in the climatic datasets
   requires that these paper records be abstracted from the world's
   archives, digitized into an electronic form, and blended into existing
   climate databases.
   As a first step in this direction, selected Royal Navy logbooks from the
   period of 1938-47, kept in the U.K. National Archives, have been
   photographed and digitized. These have provided more than 1,500,000 new
   observations for this period, and a preliminary analysis has shown
   significant improvements to the record of climate change in the
   mid-twentieth century.

AB Significant climate anomalies persist through the summer (June-August)
   after El Nino dissipates in spring over the equatorial Pacific. They
   include the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) sea surface temperature (SST)
   warming, increased tropical tropospheric temperature, an anomalous
   anticyclone over the subtropical northwest Pacific, and increased
   mei-yu-baiu rainfall over East Asia. The cause of these lingering El
   Nino effects during summer is investigated using observations and an
   atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). The results herein indicate
   that the TIO warming acts like a capacitor anchoring atmospheric
   anomalies over the Indo-western Pacific Oceans. It causes tropospheric
   temperature to increase by a moist-adiabatic adjustment in deep
   convection, emanating a baroclinic Kelvin wave into the Pacific. In the
   northwest Pacific, this equatorial Kelvin wave induces northeasterly
   surface wind anomalies, and the resultant divergence in the subtropics
   triggers suppressed convection and the anomalous anticyclone. The GCM
   results support this Kelvin wave-induced Ekman divergence mechanism. In
   response to a prescribed SST increase over the TIO, the model simulates
   the Kelvin wave with low pressure on the equator as well as suppressed
   convection and the anomalous anticyclone over the subtropical northwest
   Pacific. An additional experiment further indicates that the north
   Indian Ocean warming is most important for the Kelvin wave and northwest
   Pacific anticyclone, a result corroborated by observations.
   These results have important implications for the predictability of
   Indo-western Pacific summer climate: the spatial distribution and
   magnitude of the TIO warming, rather than simply whether there is an El
   Nino in the preceding winter, affect summer climate anomalies over the
   Indo-western Pacific and East Asia.

AB In this work, reconstructions of historical global sea surface
   temperatures (SST) are performed using Bayesian principal component
   analysis (PCA). Two PCA models are examined: a model with isotropic
   noise and a model which takes into account data uncertainty due to
   sampling errors. Inference is done by variational Bayesian learning. The
   methods are compared with a more traditional technique, reduced space
   optimal interpolation (RSOI), that is currently used in producing
   standard historical SST analyses. New methods were applied to the
   MOHSST5, an observational data set for 1856-1991 period from the United
   Kingdom Meteorological Office, that was used in a previously published
   application of the RSOI. Data uncertainty specification was also
   identical to the one used in that RSOI application, hence the
   performances of all reconstructions are directly comparable.
   Reconstruction results for 1982-1991 period are tested via their
   comparison with the NOAA monthly 1 degrees OI (version 2) that blends in
   situ observations with the much better sampled satellite data. New
   reconstructions slightly outperform the published RSOI reconstruction in
   this test and suggest that further improvements are possible.

AB The relative roles of direct atmospheric radiative forcing (due to
   observed changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases, tropospheric and
   stratospheric ozone, sulfate and volcanic aerosols, and solar output)
   and observed sea surface temperature (SST) forcing of global
   December-February atmospheric circulation trends during the second half
   of the twentieth century are investigated by means of experiments with
   an atmospheric general circulation model, Community Atmospheric Model,
   version 3 (CAM3). The model experiments are conducted by specifying the
   observed time-varying SSTs and atmospheric radiative quantities
   individually and in combination. This approach allows the authors to
   isolate the direct impact of each type of forcing agent as well as to
   evaluate their combined effect and the degree to which their impacts are
   additive. CAM3 realistically simulates the global patterns of sea level
   pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height trends when both forcings are
   specified. SST forcing and direct atmospheric radiative forcing drive
   distinctive circulation responses that contribute about equally to the
   global pattern of circulation trends. These distinctive circulation
   responses are approximately additive and partially offsetting.
   Atmospheric radiative changes directly drive the strengthening and
   poleward shift of the midlatitude westerly winds in the Southern
   Hemisphere (and to a lesser extent may contribute to those over the
   Atlantic-Eurasian sector in the Northern Hemisphere), whereas SST trends
   (specifically those in the tropics) are responsible for the
   intensification of the Aleutian low and weakening of the tropical Walker
   circulation. Discrepancies between the atmospheric circulation trends
   simulated by CAM3 and Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3),
   a coupled model driven by the same atmospheric radiative forcing as
   CAM3, are traced to differences in their tropical SST trends: in
   particular, a 60% weaker warming of the tropical Indo-Pacific in the
   CCSM3 ensemble mean than in nature.

AB Extreme climate conditions have dramatic socio-economic impacts on human
   Populations across the tropics. In Indonesia, severe drought and floods
   have been associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events
   that originate in the tropical Indo-Pacific region. Recently, an Indian
   Ocean dipole mode (IOD) in sea surface temperature (SST) has been
   proposed as another potential cause of drought and flood extremes in
   western Indonesia and elsewhere around the Indian Ocean rim. The nature
   of such variability and its degree of independence from the ENSO system
   are topics of recent debate, but understanding is hampered by the
   scarcity of: long instrumental records for the tropics. Here, we
   describe a tree-ring reconstruction of the Palmer Drought Severity Index
   (PDSI) for Java, Indonesia, that preserves a history of ENSO and
   IOD-related extremes over the past 217 years. Extreme Javan droughts
   correspond well to known ENSO and IOD events in recent decades, and most
   extreme droughts before this recent period can be explained by known
   ENSO episodes. Coral proxies from regions near or within the two poles
   of the IOD show good agreement with Javan PDSI extremes over the past
   similar to 150 years. The El Nino of 1877, in conjunction with a
   positive IOD, was one of the most intense and widespread episodes of the
   past two centuries, based on instrumental and proxy data from across the
   tropical Indo-Pacific and Asian monsoon regions. Although Java droughts
   typically show the expected association with El Nino-like conditions and
   failed Indian monsoons, others (mainly linked to positive IOD
   conditions) co-occur with a strengthened Indian monsoon, suggesting
   linkages between the Indian monsoon, Indonesian drought and Indian Ocean
   climatic variability. The close associations between the Java PDSI, ENSO
   and Indian Ocean climate are consistent with the hypothesis that
   interannual ENSO to decadal ENSO-like modes interact to generate
   dipole-like Indian Ocean variability. Copyright (C) 2008 Royal

   consists of 12 variables, the focus here is on the wind stress and wind
   stress derivative (curl and divergence) fields. SCOW seasonal cycles are
   compared with seasonal cycles estimated from NCEP-NCAR reanalysis wind

   small-scale features that are dynamically important to both the ocean
   and the atmosphere but are not resolved in other observationally based
   wind atlases or in NCEP-NCAR reanalysis fields. This is particularly
   true of the wind stress derivative fields in which topographic, SST
   gradient, and ocean current influences on surface winds are plainly
   visible. Discussions of five example regions are presented to highlight
   these seasonally recurring small-scale features. It is expected that the

AB Principal component analysis (PCA) is the most widely used method for
   dimensionality reduction, data reconstruction, feature extraction, and
   data visualization in geosciences. However, in its standard form, PCA
   makes no distinction between data points for which the associated
   measurement errors vary in both space and time. Using the backdrop of
   sea surface temperature (SST) data, a Bayesian variant of noisy
   principal component analysis (BaNPCA) was developed to incorporate
   observation uncertainty when performing PCA. The algorithm was first
   assessed using synthetic data sets. Comparison of BaNPCA results with
   current PCA techniques showed that BaNPCA has lower data reconstruction
   error; that is, for a given number of principal components, it explains
   more variance in SST data. Using the automatic relevance determination
   method, BaNPCA could correctly identify the appropriate number of
   principal components in the data. BaNPCA was shown to exhibit distinct
   advantages in filling missing values in the data when compared to
   existing methods. In addition, the extracted principal vectors from
   BaNPCA were found to be smoother and more representative of large-scale
   signals like El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation. To classify extreme states of all India summer monsoon
   rainfall, we used robust optimization that utilizes the PCs along with
   computed uncertainty from BaNPCA algorithm as inputs, thus engaging
   uncertainty in data. Results from this study demonstrate the value of
   utilizing uncertainty information available with hydrologic data sets.

AB Many coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs) suffer
   serious biases in the tropical Atlantic including a southward shift of
   the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in the annual mean, a westerly
   bias in equatorial surface winds, and a failure to reproduce the eastern
   equatorial cold tongue in boreal summer. The present study examines an
   ensemble of coupled GCMs and their uncoupled atmospheric component to
   identify common sources of error. It is found that the westerly wind
   bias also exists in the atmospheric GCMs forced with observed sea
   surface temperature, but only in boreal spring. During this time
   sea-level pressure is anomalously high (low) in the western (eastern)
   equatorial Atlantic, which appears to be related to deficient
   (excessive) precipitation over tropical South America (Africa). In
   coupled simulations, this westerly bias leads to a deepening of the
   thermocline in the east, which prevents the equatorial cold tongue from
   developing in boreal summer. Thus reducing atmospheric model errors
   during boreal spring may lead to improved coupled simulations of
   tropical Atlantic climate.

AB Water vapor constitutes the most significant greenhouse gas, is a key
   driver of many atmospheric processes, and hence, is fundamental to
   understanding the climate system. It is a major factor in human "heat
   stress," whereby increasing humidity reduces the ability to stay cool.
   Until now no truly global homogenized surface humidity dataset has
   existed with which to assess recent changes. The Met Office Hadley
   Centre and Climatic Research Unit Global Surface Humidity dataset
   (HadCRUH), described herein, provides a homogenized quality controlled
   near-global 5 degrees by 5 degrees gridded monthly mean anomaly dataset
   in surface specific and relative humidity from 1973 to 2003. It consists
   of land and marine data, and is geographically quasi-complete over the
   region 60 degrees N-40 degrees S.
   Between 1973 and 2003 surface specific humidity has increased
   significantly over the globe, tropics, and Northern Hemisphere. Global
   trends are 0.11 and 0.07 g kg(-1) (10 yr)(-1) for land and marine
   components, respectively. Trends are consistently larger in the tropics
   and in the Northern Hemisphere during summer, as expected: warmer
   regions exhibit larger increases in specific humidity for a given
   temperature change under conditions of constant relative humidity, based
   on the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Relative humidity trends are not
   significant when averaged over the landmass of the globe, tropics, and
   Northern Hemisphere, although some seasonal changes are significant.
   A strong positive bias is apparent in marine humidity data prior to
   1982, likely owing to a known change in reporting practice for dewpoint
   temperature at this time. Consequently, trends in both specific and
   relative humidity are likely underestimated over the oceans.

   and long-term trends of extreme rainfall events are modulated by the SST
   variations over the tropical Indian Ocean. The present study supports
   the hypothesis that the increasing trend of extreme rainfall events in
   the last five decades could be associated with the increasing trend of
   sea surface temperatures and surface latent heat flux over the tropical
   Indian Ocean. In the global warming scenario, the coherent relationship
   between Indian Ocean SST and extreme rainfall events suggests an

AB This paper examines monthly variability of climatological mean sea
   surface temperature (SST) in the Black Sea. A total of eight products,
   including observation-and model-based SST climatologies, are formed and
   compared with each other. Some of the observation-based SST data sets
   include only satellite measurements, while others combine in situ
   temperatures, such as those from moored and drifter buoys, with
   satellite data. Climatologies for numerical weather prediction (NWP)
   model-based data sets are formed using high temporal resolution (6
   hourly) surface temperatures. Spatial resolution of these SST products
   varies greatly (approximate to 4 km to 280 km), with the
   observation-based climatologies typically finer than the NWP-based
   climatologies. In the interior, all data sets are in general agreement,
   with annual mean SST biases typically within +/- 0.2 degrees C in
   comparison to the finest resolution (4 km) satellite-based Pathfinder
   climatology. Major differences are near the land-sea boundaries where
   model-based SSTs pose serious biases (as much as > 5 degrees C). Such
   errors are due to improper contamination of surface temperatures over
   land since coarse resolution model-based products cannot distinguish
   land and sea near the coastal boundaries. A creeping sea-fill
   interpolation improves accuracy of coastal SSTs from NWP climatologies,
   such as European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast. All
   climatologies are also evaluated against historical in situ SSTs during
   1942-2007. These comparisons confirm the relatively better accuracy of
   the observation-based climatologies.

   have generated considerable interest into why there has been such a

   studies have discussed observed multidecadal variability in the North

AB In this study, an estimate of the expected number of Atlantic tropical
   cyclones (TCs) that were missed by the observing system in the
   presatellite era ( between 1878 and 1965) is developed. The significance
   of trends in both number and duration since 1878 is assessed and these
   results are related to estimated changes in sea surface temperature
   (SST) over the "main development region" ("MDR"). The sensitivity of the
   estimate of missed TCs to underlying assumptions is examined. According
   to the base case adjustment used in this study, the annual number of TCs
   has exhibited multidecadal variability that has strongly covaried with
   multidecadal variations in MDR SST, as has been noted previously.
   However, the linear trend in TC counts (1878-2006) is notably smaller
   than the linear trend in MDR SST, when both time series are normalized
   to have the same variance in their 5-yr running mean series. Using the
   base case adjustment for missed TCs leads to an 1878-2006 trend in the
   number of TCs that is weakly positive, though not statistically
   significant, with p similar to 0.2. The estimated trend for 1900-2006 is
   highly significant (+ similar to 4.2 storms century(-1)) according to
   the results of this study. The 1900-2006 trend is strongly influenced by
   a minimum in 1910-30, perhaps artificially enhancing significance,
   whereas the 1878-2006 trend depends critically on high values in the
   late 1800s, where uncertainties are larger than during the 1900s. The
   trend in average TC duration (1878-2006) is negative and highly
   significant. Thus, the evidence for a significant increase in Atlantic
   storm activity over the most recent 125 yr is mixed, even though MDR SST
   has warmed significantly. The decreasing duration result is unexpected
   and merits additional exploration; duration statistics are more
   uncertain than those of storm counts. As TC formation, development, and
   track depend on a number of environmental factors, of which regional SST
   is only one, much work remains to be done to clarify the relationship
   between anthropogenic climate warming, the large-scale tropical
   environment, and Atlantic TC activity.

AB The dominant interannual El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon
   and the short length of climate observation records make it difficult to
   study long-term climate variations in the spatiotemporal domain. Based
   on the fact that the ENSO signal spreads to remote regions and induces
   delayed climate variation through atmospheric teleconnections, an
   ENSO-removal method is developed through which the ENSO signal can be
   approximately removed at the grid box level from the spatiotemporal
   field of a climate parameter. After this signal is removed, long-term
   climate variations are isolated at mid-and low latitudes in the climate
   parameter fields from observed and reanalysis datasets. This paper
   addresses the long-term global warming trend (GW); a companion paper
   concentrates on Pacific pan-decadal variability (PDV).
   The warming that occurs in the Pacific basin (approximately 0.4 K in the
   twentieth century) is much weaker than in surrounding regions and the
   other two ocean basins (approximately 0.8 K). The modest warming in the
   Pacific basin is likely due to its dynamic nature on the interannual and
   decadal time scales and/ or the leakage of upper ocean water through the
   Indonesian Throughflow.
   Based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National
   Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) and the 40-yr European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40),
   a comprehensive atmospheric structure associated with the GW trend is
   given. Significant discrepancies exist between the two datasets,
   especially in the tightly coupled dynamics and water vapor fields. The
   dynamics fields based on NCEP-NCAR, which show a change in the Walker
   Circulation, are consistent with the GW change in the surface
   temperature field. However, intensification in the Hadley Circulation is
   associated with GW trend in ERA-40 instead.

AB Data sets used to monitor the Earth's climate indicate that the surface
   of the Earth warmed from 1910 to 1940, cooled slightly from 1940 to
   1970, and then warmed markedly from 1970 onward(1). The weak cooling
   apparent in the middle part of the century has been interpreted in the
   context of a variety of physical factors, such as atmosphere - ocean
   interactions and anthropogenic emissions of sulphate aerosols(2). Here
   we call attention to a previously overlooked discontinuity in the record
   at 1945, which is a prominent feature of the cooling trend in the
   midtwentieth century. The discontinuity is evident in published versions
   of the global- mean temperature time series(1), but stands out more
   clearly after the data are filtered for the effects of internal climate
   variability. We argue that the abrupt temperature drop of similar to 0.3
   degrees C in 1945 is the apparent result of uncorrected instrumental
   biases in the sea surface temperature record. Corrections for the
   discontinuity are expected to alter the character of mid- twentieth
   century temperature variability but not estimates of the century-long
   trend in global- mean temperatures.

AB Globally averaged wind speeds from archived ship reports show an
   increasing trend since the 1940s, which previous studies attributed to
   the gradual shift from visually estimated to anemometer-measured winds,
   and an increase in mean anemometer height. To test this hypothesis,
   adjustments to account for these changes were applied to individual ship
   wind observations in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Almosphere
   Data Set (ICOADS). Annual means calculated from adjusted reports were
   compared to reanalysis near-surface winds in consistently well-sampled
   regions for the period 1958-2002. The adjustments to individual ship
   wind reports for known biases improve the homogeneity over the entire
   period and remove trends, prior to the early 1980s. However, for the
   21-year period 1982-2002, trends remain in the annual mean spatially
   averaged adjusted winds, of 0.4 ms(-1) decade(-1) (6% decade(-1)) for
   estimated speeds, and of 0.2 ms(-1) decade(-1) (3% decade(-1)) for
   measured speeds. In contrast, co-located reanalysis near-surface wind
   speeds show little change, 1% decade(-1) or less. Anemometers were
   installed on increasing numbers of ships during the period of study,
   even as many of these ships continued to report estimated winds. Part of
   the trend in estimated wind speeds is probably spurious, most likely a
   result of observers being increasingly influenced by readings from
   anemometers located well above 10-m. This influence is indicated by the
   gradual reduction in the tendency to underestimate nighttime marine
   winds. Results confirm earlier findings that reanalysis near-surface
   winds were biased low. The paper summarizes methods that could be
   employed to account for remaining inhomogeneities and thereby improve
   the quality of the marine wind climate record. Copyright (c) 2007 Crown

AB Indonesia is impacted by severe droughts that cause major food shortages
   over much of the country, and have long been linked with El Nino events
   in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Despite seasonal forecasts based on
   relatively complex climate models, the 1997-1998 'El Nino of the
   century' was still followed by huge shortfalls in crop production (e.g.
   a loss of 3 million tons of rice in Java alone), reflecting the large
   gap that can exist between these forecasts and their actual utilization
   in agricultural planning. Alternatively, simple predictive models of
   rainfall and crop yields for Indonesia and other Indian Ocean rim
   countries have utilized an index of equatorial Pacific sea surface
   temperatures (Nino-3.4 SST), and related this index directly to indices
   of rainfall and crop productivity. However, these latter models have not
   included climatic information from the Indian Ocean, also implicated as
   a likely cause of drought in western Indonesia. Here we show that an
   index of Indian Ocean SSTs, when combined with the previously utilized
   Nino-3.4 SSTs, provides a significantly more accurate model of Sept-Dec
   drought (PDSI) over Java, Indonesia, than Nino-3.4 SSTs alone (ar(2)
   64.5% vs 37.9%). Based solely on data for the month of August, this
   model provides the best tradeoff between model skill and adequate lead
   time for the Sept-Dec rice planting season. Such simple models can be
   used to generate readily usable early warning forecasts of drought and
   crop failure risk in Indonesia, particularly in the western part of the
   country that is most influenced by Indian Ocean climate variability.

AB The role of ocean heat transport variations in recent warming of the
   North Atlantic is investigated using an eddy-permitting global ocean
   model with prescribed atmospheric boundary conditions for 1985 - 2003.
   Variability of the model sea surface temperature compares favorably with
   satellite and in situ observations. Each data set reveals a similar
   pattern of significant surface warming over 1985 - 2003, across much of
   the North Atlantic. Significant warming trends exceed 0.1 degrees C
   a(-1) across a large area of the northwest Atlantic in the model
   simulation. Warming of the tropics and midlatitudes are considered
   separately. In both regions, long-term rises in temperature coincide
   with increasing ocean heat content in the upper few hundred meters,
   consistent with recent observations. The strongest link between surface
   temperature and heat content is found in midlatitudes. Averaged within
   each region, model surface heat fluxes do not show any major trends and
   are within the range of uncertainty in observational estimates. In
   midlatitudes, heat content increases are largely explained by changes in
   ocean heat transport across regional boundaries. While meridional heat
   transport is strongly linked to the meridional overturning circulation
   in the subtropics, such a link is weak in midlatitudes, where heat
   transport variability appears to be more strongly linked to fluctuations
   in gyre transport and eddy fluxes. It is concluded that the pattern of
   recent warming in the midlatitude North Atlantic is related to anomalous
   convergence of ocean heat transport, associated with changes in
   overturning and horizontal components of the circulation, in the
   northern subtropics and the subpolar gyre respectively.

   Indian Ocean; 2. the Dipole Mode Index (DMI), an indicator of the Indian

   model of the Java Sep-Dec Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) using a

   (ar(2) = 0.50). Both the DMI and EQWIN correlate strongly with Java
   droughts (r = 0.71 and 0.66, respectively), but weakly with wet events
   (r = 0.21 and 0.18, respectively), while the Nino SST index correlates
   moderately with both dry and wet events (r = 0.31 and 0.36,

AB In this study the causes of the seasonal cycle of mixed layer salinity
   in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean are investigated from a combination
   of satellite, atmospheric reanalysis, and in situ data sets. Results
   indicate that the salinity balance varies regionally, leading to a
   seasonal cycle in sea surface salinity (SSS) with significant spatial
   inhomogeneity. For example, horizontal salinity advection plays a key
   role in the salinity balance of the western tropical North Atlantic
   (10-25 degrees N, 50-65 degrees W), where seasonal variations in SSS are
   relatively large. In contrast, in the north-central basin (15-25 degrees
   N, 20-50 degrees W), freshening from meridional advection balances an
   excess of evaporation over precipitation, resulting in a very weak
   seasonal cycle of mixed layer salinity. Farther south (5-15 degrees N,
   20-45 degrees W), seasonal variations of precipitation are more
   significant and drive a pronounced seasonal cycle of mixed layer
   salinity. Throughout most of the tropical North Atlantic the sum of the
   surface moisture flux and horizontal advection underestimates the mixed
   layer salinity tendency during boreal fall and winter. This is the time
   of year with highest wind speeds and highest negative buoyancy flux,
   suggesting that vertical turbulent entrainment of high-salinity
   thermocline water may be important. Daily measurements from a moored
   buoy in the central tropical North Atlantic are consistent with this
   interpretation. The results of this study highlight the complexity of
   the seasonal salinity balance in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and
   the need for continued in situ monitoring of upper ocean salinity and
   currents to complement future space-based surface salinity measurements.

   ocean warming does not exceed short-term warming events over the last

   more persistent than those encountered in the last 150 years. We show

   influencing the distribution of marine taxa ranging from plankton to
   fish and turtles, are more regularly found further north in recent years
   than at any time since the 1850s. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The Dustbowl Era drought in the 1930s was the principal Midwest drought
   of the twentieth century, occurring primarily in late spring-summer
   [April-August (AMJJA)] when > 70% of annual rainfall normally occurred.
   Another major Midwest drought occurred in the 1950s but primarily in
   fall-early winter [September-December (SOND)] when normal rainfall was
   similar to 1/2 as much. Optimized canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
   is applied to forecast AMJJA and SOND Midwest rainfall variability in
   cross-validated fashion from antecedent DJF and JJA sea surface
   temperature (SST) variability in the surrounding oceans. These CCA
   models simulate (i. e., hindcast, not forecast) the Dustbowl Era drought
   of the 1930s and four of seven secondary AMJJA droughts (>= 3-yr
   duration) during the twentieth century, and the principal Midwest
   drought of the 1950s and one of three secondary SOND droughts.
   Diagnosing the model canonical correlations finds the superposition of
   tropical Pacific cool phases of the quasi-decadal oscillation (QDO) and
   interdecadal oscillation (IDO) responsible for secondary droughts in
   AMJJA when ENSO was weak and finds the eastern equatorial Pacific cool
   phase of the ENSO responsible for secondary droughts during SOND when
   ENSO was strong. These explain why secondary droughts in AMJJA occurred
   more often (nearly every decade) and were of longer duration than
   secondary droughts in SOND when decadal drought tendencies were usually
   interrupted by ENSO. These diagnostics also find the AMJJA Dustbowl Era
   drought in the 1930s and the principal SOND drought in the 1950s driven
   primarily by different phases (i. e., in quadrature) of the pentadecadal
   signal in the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO).

AB A linear inverse model (LIM) is used to predict Pacific (30 degrees S-60
   degrees N) sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs), including the
   Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). The LIM is derived from the observed
   simultaneous and lagged covariance statistics of 3-month running mean
   Pacific SSTA for the years 1951-2000. The model forecasts exhibit
   significant skill over much of the Pacific for two to three seasons in
   advance and up to a year in some locations, particulary for forecasts
   initialized in winter. The predicted and observed PDO are significantly
   correlated at leads of up to four seasons, for example, the correlation
   exceeds 0.6 for 12-month forecasts initialized in January-March (JFM).
   The LIM-based PDO forecasts are more skillful than persistence or a
   first-order autoregressive model, and have comparable skill to LIM
   forecasts of El Nino SSTAs. Filtering the data indicates that much of
   the PDO forecast skill is due to ENSO teleconnections and the global
   trend.
   Within LIM, SST anomalies can grow due to constructive interference of
   the empirically determined modes, even though the individual modes are
   damped over time. For the Pacific domain, the basinwide SST variance can
   grow for similar to 14 months, consistent with the skill of the actual
   predictions. The optimal structure (OS), the initial SSTA pattern that
   LIM indicates should increase the most rapidly with time, is clearly
   relevant to the predictions, as the OS develops into a mature ENSO and
   PDO event 6-10 months later. The OS is also consistent with the seasonal
   footprinting mechanism (SFM) and the meridional mode (MM); the SFM and
   MM involve a set of atmosphere-ocean interactions that have been
   hypothesized to initiate ENSO events.

   the early 1800s from ships, augmented in recent decades by in situ
   measurements from buoys and other automated Ocean Data Acquisition
   Systems (ODAS). SST, unlike some other ICOADS variables such as surface
   air temperature or humidity, is observed from space with reasonable
   accuracy. However, without reference to in situ measurements most
   satellite-based SST products will contain large-scale biases due to
   varying atmospheric composition and imperfect instrumental calibration.
   ICOADS is vital to the removal of such biases, which are especially
   large following volcanic eruptions. We describe products combining in
   situ and satellite SSTs that exploit the strengths of each type of
   measurement, to yield both high resolution and high accuracy. Finally,
   we discuss future developments anticipated for lCOADS and SST products,
   such as further blending of metadata and enhanced product uncertainty
   assessments.

AB Ship activity patterns depicted by the International Comprehensive
   Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), the Automated Mutual-Assistance
   Vessel Rescue System (AMVER) data set, and their combination demonstrate
   different spatial and statistical sampling biases. These differences
   could significantly affect the accuracy of ship emissions inventories
   and atmospheric modeling. We demonstrate (using ICOADS) a method to
   improve global-proxy representativeness by trimming over-reporting
   vessels that mitigates sampling bias, augment the sample data set, and
   account for ship heterogeneity. Apparent under-reporting to ICOADS and
   AMVER by ships near coastlines, perhaps engaged in coastwise (short sea)
   shipping especially in Europe, indicates that bottom-up regional
   inventories may be more representative locally. Primarily due to the
   long time series available publicly for ICOADS data, the improved ICOADS
   data set may be the most appropriate global ship traffic proxy
   identified to date to be used for a top-down approach. More generally,
   these three spatial proxies can be used together to perform uncertainty
   analyses of ship air-emissions impacts on a global scale
   (http://coast.cms.udel.edu/GlobalShipEmissions/).

AB Successful ecosystem-based conservation of marine resources can benefit
   from quantitative indicators of ecosystem productivity, particularly if
   such indicators quantify and incorporate the relationships between
   physical and biological components of the ecosystem simultaneously.
   Despite widespread explorations of relationships between physical
   processes particularly important to the ocean system (e.g. wind indices,
   advection and retention of coastal waters, sea surface temperature,
   coastal sea level and the temporal aspects of these factors) and
   resulting biological responses, explicit understanding of mechanistic
   connections often remains elusive. We use path analysis and partial
   least squares regression to visualize and quantify links between
   biological and physical components in the California Current ecosystem
   and to predict reproductive success at 3 trophic levels, We examine the
   applicability of this approach using a hierarchical pattern Of
   environmental indices, relationships previously described in the
   literature and quantitative measures of zooplankton, fish and seabird
   productivity. We show that each trophic level and community production
   can be described using environmental and biological data in a manner
   that provides a comprehensive evaluation of physical and biological
   connectivity and mechanisms. Importantly, our approach to modeling an
   ecosystem represents a practical middle ground between simple
   correlative methods typically employed and a perhaps unattainable
   complete mechanistic understanding of all physical and biological
   mechanisms regulating variability in reproductive success.

AB High winds at sea are feared by sailors, but their distribution is
   poorly known because ships have avoided them as much as possible. The
   accumulation of spaceborne scatterometer measurements now allows a
   global mapping of high winds over the ocean. Seven years of Quick
   Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) data gathered since July 1999 show that
   high-wind events, defined as wind speeds greater than 20 m s(-1)
   ("strong gale" and higher on the Beaufort scale), mostly happen in
   winter. Over coastal regions, land orography is the major cause of high
   winds, forcing wind jets of various types. Over the open ocean, high
   winds tend to be collocated with the extratropical storm tracks, along
   which migratory low and high pressure systems travel eastward. In
   comparison, tropical cyclones do not leave a strong signature in the
   climatology of high-wind occurrence except in the western Pacific east
   of Taiwan. In the extratropics, sea surface temperature (SST) fronts and
   their meanders significantly change the frequency of high-wind events.
   For example, high winds occur twice as often (or more) over the warmer
   than the colder flank of the Gulf Stream, and over the poleward than
   equatorward meanders of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The
   collocation of frequent high winds and SST frontal zones is not a mere
   coincidence because SST gradients anchor storm tracks, which in turn
   sustain the surface westerlies against friction with lateral heat and
   momentum flux. Both the high mean speed and large variance of wind
   increase the probability of high winds. Implications for navigation
   safety and oceanographic and climate research are discussed.

AB Sedimentary molecular biomarker compositions, organic carbon and CaCO3

   document a series of paleoclimatic changes that have affected organic
   matter production and sedimentation in the North Aegean Sea from the
   termination of the latest glacial maximum through the middle Holocene.
   Continental environmental conditions have been inferred from land-plant
   biomarkers. Paleoproductivity patterns of diatoms, prymnesiophytes,
   dinoflagellates, and nannoplankton were discerned from marine-derived
   biomarkers. Although organic matter is predominantly marine, variations
   in the proportion of marine and land contributions and in its general
   preservation are evident. Rapid changes in the Eastern Mediterranean
   thermohaline circulation evidently occurred in parallel to sea surface
   temperature oscillations. Enhanced deep-water ventilation accompanied
   cold intervals in the late Last Glacial, the Younger Dryas, and during
   an interruption of deposition of the S-1 sapropel, probably in response
   to strengthening of north winds over the region. In contrast, decreased
   thermohaline circulation occurred during the warm interval associated
   with the S-1 sapropel. During this period, increased freshwater inputs
   diminished ventilation of deep-water masses and enhanced organic matter
   production and preservation. Intriguing fluctuations in sea-surface
   temperatures and the concentrations of marine and terrestrial biomarkers
   within the sapropelic layer, most prominently in the interruption from
   8.2 to 7.8 calibrated radiocarbon conventional kyr BP, support the
   hypothesis that several distinct events of deep water reoxygenation
   occurred in the North Aegean Sea during deposition of the S, sapropel.
   These events reflect centennial excursions to the more common
   low-productivity and well ventilated conditions of the Mediterranean
   that may possibly be related to North Atlantic Oscillation cycles. (c)

   smaller than the visual observations do. The largest differences are
   observed in the mid and sub-polar latitudes. In the tropics, NCEP-NCAR

   have been developed using optimum interpolation (OI). The analyses have
   a spatial grid resolution of 0.25 degrees and a temporal resolution of 1
   day. One product uses the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
   (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. The other uses AVHRR and Advanced
   Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System
   satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and
   buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with
   respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather
   coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added
   to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance
   jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the
   results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to
   previous weekly 1 degrees OI analyses.
   The AVHRR-only product uses Pathfinder AVHRR data (currently available
   from January 1985 to December 2005) and operational AVHRR data for 2006
   onward. Pathfinder AVHRR was chosen over operational AVHRR, when
   available, because Pathfinder agrees better with the in situ data. The
   AMSR AVHRR product begins with the start of AMSR data in June 2002. In
   this product, the primary AVHRR contribution is in regions near land
   where AMSR is not available. However, in cloud-free regions, use of both
   infrared and microwave instruments can reduce systematic biases because
   their error characteristics are independent.

AB Recent studies, based largely on analyses of reanalysis datasets,
   suggest that the Northern Hemisphere winter storm track activity has
   increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century.
   In this study, this increasing trend, in terms of filtered mean sea
   level pressure (MSLP) variance statistics, is assessed using surface
   ship observations and a statistical storm track model.
   MSLP observations made by ships, archived as part of the reanalysis
   project conducted by the National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research, have been analyzed.
   Observational errors are estimated by comparing reports of nearly
   collocated observations. Consistent with previous studies, the
   observational errors of ship pressure observations are found to be very
   large during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Without correcting for
   observational errors, the storm track activity over the Pacific,
   computed based on ship observations, is found to be decreasing with
   time, while the upward trend in the Atlantic is much smaller than that
   found in the reanalysis data. Even after corrections have been made to
   account for secular changes in observational error statistics, the
   ship-based trend in the Pacific is still found to be much smaller than
   that found in the reanalysis, while over the Atlantic, the corrected
   ship-based trend is consistent with that found in the reanalysis.
   The robustness of the results is tested by application of data trimming
   based on the reanalysis products. Ship observations that are different
   from the reanalysis by more than a prescribed limit are removed before
   the statistics are computed. As the prescribed limit is reduced from 30
   to 2.5 hPa, the ship-based storm track activity becomes increasingly
   consistent with that based on the reanalysis. However, even when the
   smallest limit is used, the trends computed from the ship observations
   are still smaller than those computed from the reanalysis, strongly
   suggesting that the trends in the reanalysis are biased high.
   Nevertheless, the results suggest that decadal-scale variability of the
   Atlantic storm track activity is not very sensitive to the trimming
   limit, while results for the Pacific storm track are not as robust.
   As an independent corroboration of the ship observation results, a
   statistical model is used to test whether the storm track trend found in
   the reanalysis is dynamically consistent with observed mean flow change.
   Five hundred winters of GCM simulations are used to construct a linear
   model based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA), using monthly mean
   distribution of MSLP anomalies as a predictor to hindcast monthly mean
   MSLP variance. The Atlantic storm track in the CCA model hindcast is
   well correlated with the storm track in the reanalysis on both
   interannual and decadal time scales, with the hindcast trend being 82%
   of that found in the reanalysis. Over the Pacific, the CCA hindcast does
   not perform as well, and the hindcast trend is only 32% of that found in
   the reanalysis.
   The results of this study suggest that the actual trend in Pacific storm
   track activity is probably only about 20%-60% of that found in the
   reanalysis, while over the Atlantic, the actual trend is likely to be
   about 70%-80% of that found in the reanalysis. Two new basinwide storm
   track indices, which should contain less bias in the secular trends,
   have been defined based mainly on ship observations.

AB Water vapour is the most important contributor to the natural greenhouse
   effect, and the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is expected to
   increase under conditions of greenhouse-gas-induced warming, leading to
   a significant feedback on anthropogenic climate change(1-3). Theoretical
   and modelling studies predict that relative humidity will remain
   approximately constant at the global scale as the climate warms, leading
   to an increase in specific humidity(1,4,5). Although significant
   increases in surface specific humidity have been identified in several
   regions(6-9), and on the global scale in non-homogenized data(10), it
   has not been shown whether these changes are due to natural or human
   influences on climate. Here we use a new quality-controlled and
   homogenized gridded observational data set of surface humidity, with
   output from a coupled climate model, to identify and explore the causes
   of changes in surface specific humidity over the late twentieth century.
   We identify a significant global-scale increase in surface specific
   humidity that is attributable mainly to human influence. Specific
   humidity is found to have increased in response to rising temperatures,
   with relative humidity remaining approximately constant. These changes
   may have important implications, because atmospheric humidity is a key
   variable in determining the geographical distribution(11-13) and maximum
   intensity(14) of precipitation, the potential maximum intensity of
   tropical cyclones(15), and human heat stress(16), and has important
   effects on the biosphere(17) and surface hydrology(17,18).

AB The importance of the diurnal variability of sea surface temperature
   (SST) on air-sea interaction is now being increasingly recognized. This
   review synthesizes knowledge of the diurnal SST variation, mainly paying
   attention to its impact on the atmosphere or the ocean. Diurnal SST
   warming becomes evident when the surface wind is weak and insolation is
   strong. Recent observations using satellite data and advanced
   instruments have revealed that a large diurnal SST rise occurs over wide
   areas in a specific season, and in an extreme case the diurnal amplitude
   of SST exceeds 5 K. The large diurnal SST rise can lead to an increase
   in net surface heat flux from the ocean of 50-60 WM-2 in the daytime.
   The temporal mean of the increase exceeds 10 Wm-2, which will be
   non-negligible for the atmosphere. A few numerical experiments have
   indicated that the diurnal SST variation can modify atmospheric
   properties over the Pacific warm pool or a coastal sea, but the
   processes underlying the modification have not yet been investigated in
   detail. Furthermore, it has been shown that the diurnal change of ocean
   mixing process near the surface must be considered correctly in order to
   reproduce SST variations on an intraseasonal scale in a numerical model.
   The variation of mixed-layer properties on the daily scale is
   nonlinearly related to the intraseasonal variability. The mixed-layer
   deepen ing/shoal in g process on the daily scale will also be related to
   biological and material circulation processes.

AB Monthly surface air temperatures from land surface stations, automatic
   weather stations, and ship/ buoy observations from the high- latitude
   Southern Hemisphere are synthesized into gridded analyses at a
   resolution appropriate for applications ranging from spatial trend
   analyses to climate change impact assessments. Correlation length scales
   are used to enhance information content while limiting the spatial
   extent of influence of the sparse data in the Antarctic region. The
   correlation length scales are generally largest in summer and over the
   Antarctic continent, while they are shortest over the winter sea ice.
   Gridded analyses of temperature anomalies, limited to regions within a
   correlation length scale of at least one observation, are constructed
   and validated against observed temperature anomalies in single- station-
   out experiments. Trends calculated for the 1958 - 2002 period suggest
   modest warming over much of the 60 - 90 S domain. All seasons show
   warming, with winter trends being the largest at + 0.172 degrees C
   decade 1 while summer warming rates are only +0.045 degrees C
   decade(-1). The 45-yr temperature trend for the annual means is +0.082
   degrees C decade(-1) corresponding to a +0.371 degrees C temperature
   change over the 1958 - 2002 period of record. Trends computed using
   these analyses show considerable sensitivity to start and end dates,
   with trends calculated using start dates prior to 1965 showing overall
   warming, while those using start dates from 1966 to 1982 show net
   cooling over the region. Because of the large interannual variability of
   temperatures over the continental Antarctic, most of the continental
   trends are not statistically significant. However, the statistically
   significant warming over the Antarctic Peninsula is the strongest and
   most seasonally robust in the spatial patterns of temperature change.
   Composite ( 11- model) global climate model ( GCM) simulations for 1958
   - 2002 with forcing from historic aerosol and greenhouse gas
   concentrations show warming patterns and magnitudes similar to the
   corresponding observed trends for the 45- yr period. GCM projections for
   the rest of the twenty- first century, however, discontinue the pattern
   of strongest warming over the Antarctic Peninsula, but instead show the
   strongest warming over the Antarctic continent.

AB Using a climate model of intermediate complexity, we simulate the
   response of the El Ni (n) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system
   to solar and orbital forcing over the Holocene. Solar forcing is
   reconstructed from radiocarbon production rate data, using various
   scaling factors to account for the conflicting estimates of solar
   irradiance variability. As estimates of the difference since the Maunder
   Minimum range from 0.05% to 0.5% of the solar "constant,'' we consider
   these two extreme scenarios, along with the intermediate case of 0.2%.
   We show that for large or moderate forcings, the low-pass-filtered
   east-west sea surface temperature gradient along the equator responds
   almost linearly to irradiance forcing, with a short phase lag (about a
   decade). Wavelet analysis shows a statistically significant enhancement
   of the century-to-millennial-scale ENSO variability for even a moderate
   irradiance forcing. In contrast, the 0.05% case displays no such
   enhancement. Orbitally driven insolation forcing is found to produce a
   long-term increase of ENSO variability from the early Holocene onward,
   in accordance with previous findings. When both forcings are combined,
   the superposition is approximately linear in the strong scaling case.
   Overall, the sea surface temperature response is of the magnitude
   required, and is persistent enough, to induce important climatic
   perturbations worldwide. The results suggest that ENSO may plausibly
   have acted as a mediator between the Sun and the Earth's climate. A
   comparison to key Holocene climate records, from the Northern Hemisphere
   subtropics and midlatitudes, shows support for this hypothesis.

   include SST anomalies along the Benguela Coast, a general warming or
   cooling of the tropical oceans, Atlantic SSTs specifically, the contrast
   between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and the Pacific El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO). These factors differ seasonally. In much of the
   region, rainfall variability is linked to the Pacific El Nino and the
   western Indian Ocean early in the year, but to the Atlantic during the
   boreal summer months. The Indian Ocean again becomes important in late
   summer/early fall.
   The role of the Atlantic appears to be the modulation of the north-south
   excursion of the Intertropical convergence Zone (ITCZ). Hence the
   polarity of the SST/rainfall association depends on location. The
   association between SSTs near the coast and rainfall is positive if the
   influence is direct but can be positive or negative for indirect
   influences. An opposition between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans appears
   to displace convection in an east-west direction.
   Our results suggest several generic conclusions concerning the link
   between SSTs and continental rainfall. One is that the influence of the
   three oceans is seasonally dependent. The impact of a specific SST
   anomaly is also seasonally dependent. The same SST pattern may enhance
   rainfall in one season, but reduce it in the following season. Finally,
   the SST/rainfall associations are generally not symmetric. That is, the
   factors producing wet conditions are not the reverse of those producing
   dry conditions. In order to understand these associations, the
   underlying mechanisms via the general atmospheric circulation must be
   determined. Copyright (C) 2007 Royal Meteorological Society.

AB In this article, we first discuss our perception of the factors which
   are critical for inter-annual variation of the Indian summer monsoon
   rainfall and the major milestones leading to this understanding. The
   nature of the two critical modes for monsoon variability, viz. El Nino
   Southern Oscillation and equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation is
   considered and their links to the monsoon elucidated. We suggest
   possible reasons for the rather poor skill of simulation of the
   interannual variation of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall by
   atmospheric general circulation models, run with the observed sea
   surface temperature as boundary condition. We discuss implications of
   what we have learned for the monsoon of 2006, and possible use of
   information on the two important modes for prediction of the rainfall in
   all or part of the summer monsoon season. We conclude with our view of
   what the focus of research and development should be for achieving a
   substantial improvement in the skill of simulation and prediction of the
   Indian summer monsoon rainfall the near future.

   passing the cyclone tracks taken from 1976 to 2005 through ship
   observations from 1900 to 1965. The probability of detection is equated
   to the probability that the ships would have made wind observations of
   18 m/ s or higher had the tropical cyclones been present during the
   earlier years, based on the probability computed from actual wind
   observations around tropical cyclones during the satellite era. It is
   estimated that the number of tropical cyclones not making landfall over
   any continent or the Caribbeans may have been underestimated by up to
   2.1 per year during 1904 1913, with this number decreasing to 1.0 per

AB The effects of clouds and sea ice on the solar radiation budget are
   determined for the Southern Ocean around Antarctica between latitudes 50
   degrees and 80 degrees S. Distributions of cloud optical depth are used,
   together with distributions of surface albedo, to estimate the
   geographical and seasonal variations of shortwave irradiance and cloud
   radiative forcing at the surface, both for the present climate and for
   altered surface and cloud conditions. Poleward of 68 degrees S in
   spring, ice causes a greater reduction of solar energy input to the
   surface than does cloud. However, in summer the clouds are more
   important than ice at all latitudes in the Southern Ocean.
   In the present climate the clouds are optically thicker over open water
   than over sea ice, suggesting a possible negative feedback if the sea
   ice area shrinks with climatic warming. Compared to the present climate
   in spring, removing sea ice results in an increase in irradiance
   reaching the ocean surface, regardless of the type of cloud remaining.
   However, in summer the removal of ice results in higher irradiance at
   the surface only if clouds remain unchanged. If clouds become as thick
   as those presently over the ocean at 55-60 S, irradiance reaching the
   ocean surface in summer decreases poleward of 65 degrees S.

AB We present an analysis of the sensitivity to different physical
   parameterizations of a high-resolution simulation of the MM5 mesoscale
   model over the Iberian Peninsula. Several (16) 5-year runs of the MM5
   model with varying parameterizations of microphysics, cumulus, planetary
   boundary layer and longwave radiation have been carried out. The results
   have been extensively compared with observational precipitation and
   surface temperature data. The parameterization uncertainty has also been
   compared with that related to the boundary conditions and the varying
   observational data sets. The annual cycles of precipitation and surface
   temperature are well reproduced. The summer season presents the largest
   deviations, with a 5 K cold bias in the southeast and noticeable
   precipitation errors over mountain areas. The cold bias seems to be
   related to the surface, probably because of the excessive moisture
   availability of the five-layer soil scheme used. No parameterization
   combination was found to perform best in simulating both precipitation
   and surface temperature in every season and subregion. The Kain-Fritsch
   cumulus scheme was found to produce unrealistically high summer
   precipitation. The longwave radiation parameterizations tested were
   found to have little impact on our target variables. Other factors, such
   as the choice of boundary conditions, have an impact on the results as
   large as the selection of parameterizations. The range of variability in
   the MM5 physics ensemble is of the same order of magnitude as the
   observational uncertainty, except in summer, when it is larger and
   probably related to the inaccuracy of the model to reproduce the summer
   precipitation over the area.

AB We examine the relationship between the state of the equatorial Indian
   Ocean, ENSO, and the Indian summer monsoon rainfall using data from 1881
   to 1998. The zonal wind anomalies and SST anomaly gradient over the
   equatorial Indian Ocean are used as indices that represent the condition
   of the Indian Ocean. Although the index defined by the zonal wind
   anomalies correlates poorly with Indian summer monsoon rainfall, the
   linear reconstruction of Indian summer monsoon rainfall on the basis of
   a multiple regression from the NINO3 and this wind index better
   specifies the Indian summer monsoon rainfall than the regression with
   only NINO3. Using contingency tables, we find that the negative
   association between the categories of Indian summer monsoon rainfall and
   the wind index is significant during warm years (El Ni (n) over tildeo)
   but not during cold years (La Ni (n) over tildea). Composite maps of
   land precipitation also indicate that this relationship is significant
   during Ell Ni (n) over tildeo events. We conclude that there is a
   significant negative association between Indian summer monsoon rainfall
   and the zonal wind anomalies over the equatorial Indian Ocean during Ell
   Ni (n) over tildeo events. A similar investigation of the relationship
   between the SST index and Indian summer monsoon rainfall does not reveal

AB Sampling uncertainties in the voluntary observing ship (VOS)-based
   global ocean-atmosphere flux fields were estimated using the NCEP-NCAR
   reanalysis and ECMWF 40-yr Re-Analysis (ERA-40) as well as seasonal
   forecasts without data assimilation. Air-sea fluxes were computed from
   6-hourly reanalyzed individual variables using state-of-the-art bulk
   formulas. Individual variables and computed fluxes were subsampled to
   simulate VOS-like sampling density. Random simulation of the number of
   VOS observations and simulation of the number of observations with
   contemporaneous sampling allowed for estimation of random and total
   sampling uncertainties respectively. Although reanalyses are dependent
   on VOS, constituting an important part of data assimilation input, it is
   assumed that the reanalysis fields adequately reproduce synoptic
   variability at the sea surface. Sampling errors were quantified by
   comparison of the regularly sampled (i.e., 6 hourly) and subsampled
   monthly fields of surface variables and fluxes. In poorly sampled
   regions random sampling errors amount to 2.5 degrees-3 degrees C for air
   temperature, 3 ms(-1) for the wind speed, 2-2.5 g kg(-1) for specific
   humidity, and 15%-20% of the total cloud cover. The highest random
   sampling errors in surface fluxes were found for the sensible and latent
   heat flux and range from 30 to 80 W m(-2). Total sampling errors in
   poorly sampled areas may be higher than random ones by 60%. In poorly
   sampled subpolar latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and throughout
   much of the Southern Ocean the total sampling uncertainty in the net
   heat flux can amount to 80-100 W m(-2). The highest values of the
   uncertainties associated with the interpolation/extrapolation into
   unsampled grid boxes are found in subpolar latitudes of both hemispheres
   for the turbulent fluxes, where they can be comparable with the sampling
   errors. Simple dependencies of the sampling errors on the number of
   samples and the magnitude of synoptic variability were derived. Sampling
   errors estimated from different reanalyses and from seasonal forecasts
   yield qualitatively comparable spatial patterns, in which the actual
   values of uncertainties are controlled by the magnitudes of synoptic
   variability. Finally, estimates of sampling uncertainties are compared
   with the other errors in air-sea fluxes and the reliability of the
   estimates obtained is discussed.

AB Using the same approach as in Part I, here it is shown how sampling
   problems in voluntary observing ship (VOS) data affect conclusions about
   interannual variations and secular changes of surface heat fluxes. The
   largest uncertainties in linear trend estimates are found in relatively
   poorly sampled regions like the high-latitude North Atlantic and North
   Pacific as well as the Southern Ocean, where trends can locally show
   opposite signs when computed from the regularly sampled and undersampled
   data. Spatial patterns of shorter-period interannual variability,
   quantified through the EOF analysis, also show remarkable differences
   between the regularly sampled and undersampled flux datasets in the
   Labrador Sea and northwest Pacific. In particular, it is shown that in
   the Labrador Sea region, in contrast to regularly sampled NCEP-NCAR
   reanalysis fluxes, VOS-like sampled NCEP-NCAR reanalysis fluxes neither
   show significant interannual variability nor significant trends. These
   regions, although quite localized covering small parts of the globe,
   play a crucial role for the coupled atmosphere - ocean system. In the
   Labrador Sea, for instance, interannual and decadal-scale changes of the
   surface net heat fluxes are known to affect oceanic convection and,
   thus, the meridional overturning circulation of the Atlantic Ocean. From
   a discussion of current atmospheric data assimilation systems it is
   argued that in poorly sampled regions reanalysis products are superior
   to VOS-based products for studying interannual and interdecadal
   variations of atmosphere - ocean interaction. In well-sampled regions,
   on the other hand, conclusions about surface heat flux variations are
   relatively insensitive to the choice of the flux products used (VOS
   versus reanalysis data). The results are confirmed for two different
   datasets, that is, ECMWF 40-yr Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data and seasonal
   integrations with a recent version of the ECMWF model in which no actual

AB This study examines the contribution of tropical sea surface temperature
   (SST) forcing to the 1976/77 climate transition of the winter
   atmospheric circulation over the North Pacific using a combined
   observational and modeling approach. The National Center for Atmospheric
   Research (NCAR) Community Atmospheric Model version 3 (CAM3) simulates
   approximately 75% of the observed 4-hPa deepening of the wintertime
   Aleutian low from 1950-76 to 1977-2000 when forced with the observed
   evolution of tropical SSTs in a 10-member ensemble average. This
   response is driven by precipitation increases over the western half of
   the equatorial Pacific Ocean. In contrast, the NCAR Community Climate
   Model version 3 (CCM3), the predecessor to CAM3, simulates no
   significant change in the strength of the Aleutian low when forced with
   the same tropical SSTs in a 12-member ensemble average. The lack of
   response in CCM3 is traced to an erroneously large precipitation
   increase over the tropical Indian Ocean whose dynamical impact is to
   weaken the Aleutian low; this, when combined with the response to
   rainfall increases over the western and central equatorial Pacific,
   results in near-zero net change in the strength of the Aleutian low. The
   observed distribution of tropical precipitation anomalies associated
   with the 1976/77 transition, estimated from a combination of direct
   measurements at land stations and indirect information from surface
   marine cloudiness and wind divergence fields, supports the models'
   simulated rainfall increases over the western half of the Pacific but
   not the magnitude of CCM3's rainfall increase over the Indian Ocean.

AB An upgraded version of the Hadley Centre's monthly historical mean sea
   level pressure (MSLP) dataset ( HadSLP2) is presented. HadSLP2 covers
   the period from 1850 to date, and is based on numerous terrestrial and
   marine data compilations. Each terrestrial pressure series used in
   HadSLP2 underwent a series of quality control tests, and erroneous or
   suspect values were either corrected, where possible, or removed. Marine
   observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data
   Set were quality controlled (assessed against climatology and near
   neighbors) and then gridded. The final gridded form of HadSLP2 was
   created by blending together the processed terrestrial and gridded
   marine MSLP data. MSLP fields were made spatially complete using
   reduced-space optimal interpolation. Gridpoint error estimates were also
   produced.
   HadSLP2 was found to have generally stronger subtropical anticyclones
   and higher-latitude features across the Northern Hemisphere than an
   earlier product (HadSLP1). During the austral winter, however, it
   appears that the pressures in the southern Atlantic and Indian Ocean
   midlatitude regions are too high; this is seen in comparisons with both
   HadSLP1 and the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40). Over regions of high
   altitude, HadSLP2 and ERA-40 showed consistent differences suggestive of
   potential biases in the reanalysis model, though the region over the
   Himalayas in HadSLP2 is biased compared with HadSLP1 and improvements
   are required in this region. Consistent differences were also observed
   in regions of sparse data, particularly over the higher latitudes of the
   Southern Ocean and in the southeastern Pacific. Unlike the earlier
   HadSLP1 product, error estimates are available with HadSLP2 to guide the
   user in these regions of low confidence.
   An evaluation of major phenomena in the climate system using HadSLP2
   provided further validation of the dataset. Important climatic
   features/indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic
   Oscillation, North Pacific index, Southern Oscillation index,
   Trans-Polar index, Antarctic Oscillation, Antarctic Circumpolar Wave,
   East Asian Summer Monsoon index, and the Siberian High index have all
   been resolved in HadSLP2, with extensions back to the mid-nineteenth
   century.

   collection of surface meteorological observations for 1958-2002, but
   require much more complicated preprocessing than standard meteorological
   variables such as sea level pressure, temperature, and wind. Visual VOS
   data allow for separate analysis of changes in wind sea and swell, as
   well as in significant wave height, which has been derived from wind sea
   and swell estimates. In both North Atlantic and North Pacific
   midlatitudes winter significant wave height shows a secular increase
   from 10 to 40 cm decade(-1) during the last 45 yr. However, in the North
   Atlantic the patterns of trend changes for wind sea and swell are quite

   leading modes demonstrate noticeable differences for wind sea and swell.
   Statistical analysis shows that variability in wind sea is closely
   associated with the local wind speed, while swell changes can be driven
   by the variations in the cyclone counts, implying the importance of
   forcing frequency for the resulting changes in significant wave height.
   This mechanism of differences in variability patterns of wind sea and
   swell is likely more realistic than the northeastward propagation of
   swells from the regions from which the wind sea signal originates.

AB Research and forecasts of the weather-ocean-climate system demand
   increasingly higher resolution forcing data. Here we assess the
   improvement in composite global observations and the feasibility of
   producing high resolution blended sea winds. The number of the long-term
   US sea surface wind speed observing satellites has increased from one in
   July 1987 to five or more since 2000. Global 0.25 degrees gridded,
   blended products with temporal resolutions of 6-hours, 12-hours and
   daily have become feasible since mid 2002, mid 1995 and January 1991,
   respectively ( with >= 75% time coverage and >= 90% spatial coverage
   between 65 degrees S - 65 degrees N). If the coverage is relaxed, the
   feasible times can be extended to earlier periods. These statistics
   provide practical guidance to produce reliable blended products for
   different applications, and serve as guidance on the design of future
   global observing systems.

AB In situ observations of surface air and dewpoint temperatures and air
   pressure from over 15 000 weather stations and from ships are used to
   calculate surface specific (q) and relative ( RH) humidity over the
   globe (60 degrees S - 75 degrees N) from December 1975 to spring 2005.
   Seasonal and interannual variations and linear trends are analyzed in
   relation to observed surface temperature ( T) changes and simulated
   changes by a coupled climate model [ namely the Parallel Climate Model
   (PCM)] with realistic forcing. It is found that spatial patterns of
   long-term mean q are largely controlled by climatological surface
   temperature, with the largest q of 17 - 19 g kg(-1) in the Tropics and
   large seasonal variations over northern mid- and high-latitude land.
   Surface RH has relatively small spatial and interannual variations, with
   a mean value of 75% - 80% over most oceans in all seasons and 70% - 80%
   over most land areas except for deserts and high terrain, where RH is
   30% - 60%. Nighttime mean RH is 2% - 15% higher than daytime RH over
   most land areas because of large diurnal temperature variations. The
   leading EOFs in both q and RH depict long-term trends, while the second
   EOF of q is related to the El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During
   1976 - 2004, global changes in surface RH are small ( within 0.6% for
   absolute values), although decreasing trends of - 0.11% similar to-
   0.22% decade(-1) for global oceans are statistically significant. Large
   RH increases (0.5% - 2.0% decade(-1)) occurred over the central and
   eastern United States, India, and western China, resulting from large q
   increases coupled with moderate warming and increases in low clouds over
   these regions during 1976 - 2004. Statistically very significant
   increasing trends are found in global and Northern Hemispheric q and T.
   From 1976 to 2004, annual q ( T) increased by 0.06 g kg(-1) (0.16
   degrees C) decade(-1) globally and 0.08 g kg(-1) (0.20 degrees C)
   decade(-1) in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemispheric q
   trend is positive but statistically insignificant. Over land, the q and
   T trends are larger at night than during the day. The largest percentage
   increases in surface q ( similar to 1.5% to 6.0% decade(-1)) occurred
   over Eurasia where large warming ( similar to 0.2 degrees to 0.7 degrees
   C decade(-1)) was observed. The q and T trends are found in all seasons
   over much of Eurasia ( largest in boreal winter) and the Atlantic Ocean.
   Significant correlation between annual q and T is found over most oceans
   ( r = 0.6 - 0.9) and most of Eurasia ( r = 0.4 - 0.8), whereas it is
   insignificant over subtropical land areas. RH - T correlation is weak
   over most of the globe but is negative over many arid areas. The q - T
   anomaly relationship is approximately linear so that surface q over the
   globe, global land, and ocean increases by similar to 4.9%, 4.3%, and
   5.7% per 1 degrees C warming, respectively, values that are close to
   those suggested by the Clausius - Clapeyron equation with a constant RH.
   The recent q and T trends and the q - T relationship are broadly
   captured by the PCM; however, the model overestimates volcanic cooling
   and the trends in the Southern Hemisphere.

   a result, two dominant modes are detected that correspond well to the

   SAT modes and atmospheric circulation can be interpreted statistically.
   The first mode represents SAT variations in the central part of Japan.
   The second mode represents those in the northern part. Greater than 75%
   of SAT variations can be explained by these two leading modes. The first
   mode accompanies variations of sunshine duration, and is related with
   the strength of the Tibetan High. The second mode involves
   quasi-six-year periodicity, and accompanies an appearance of the shallow
   type of the Okhotsk High, with the cold northeasterly winds that is
   related with the convective activity around the Philippine Islands.

AB The development of a daily historical European-North Atlantic mean sea
   level pressure dataset (EMSLP) for 1850-2003 on a 5 latitude by
   longitude grid is described. This product was produced using 86
   continental and island stations distributed over the region 25
   degrees-70 degrees N, 70 degrees W-50 degrees E blended with marine data
   from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS).
   The EMSLP fields for 1850-80 are based purely on the land station data
   and ship observations. From 1881, the blended land and marine fields are
   combined with already available daily Northern Hemisphere fields.
   Complete coverage is obtained by employing reduced space optimal
   interpolation. Squared correlations (r(2)) indicate that EMSLP generally
   captures 80%-90% of daily variability represented in an existing
   historical mean sea level pressure product and over 90% in modern 40-yr
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analyses (ERA-40)
   over most of the region. A lack of sufficient observations over
   Greenland and the Middle East, however, has resulted in poorer
   reconstructions there. Error estimates, produced as part of the
   reconstruction technique, flag these as regions of low confidence. It is
   shown that the EMSLP daily fields and associated error estimates provide
   a unique opportunity to examine the circulation patterns associated with
   extreme events across the European-North Atlantic region, such as the
   2003 heat wave, in the context of historical events.

AB [ 1] We have produced global daily high-resolution analytical sea
   surface temperature (SST) data for the latter half of the 1990s from
   four kinds of different satellite SST products, including microwave SST,
   from 1998. The optimum interpolation (OI) method is applied to SST
   anomaly from climatological annual signal with the decorrelation scales
   of the first-guess error of less than 200 km. The effective spatial
   resolution of the OI SST is a few hundred kilometers due to these
   scales. The monthly mean difference between this OI SST and in situ SST
   averaged in 60 degrees S - 60 degrees N are almost within +/- 0.1 K. The
   root-mean square differences between them are less than 0.6 K in most of
   open oceans. From 1995 to 1997, when only one or two infrared SST
   products are available, the difference from the in situ SST tends to be
   negative because one of the infrared SST used here has a slight cool
   bias throughout the period. This bias decreases or becomes positive upon
   being combined with other satellite SST data. Fine spatial structure
   that cannot be seen in a 1 degrees-grid analytical SST is clearly
   represented, and mesoscale spatial variations with a wavelength of 400 -
   500 km are captured in this OI SST. The temporal variability of the OI
   SST is also examined at a few points using a wavelet technique. The OI
   SST can nearly capture variations in the period of more than 1 month,
   although there are still some differences in the variations between the
   OI SST and buoy SST.

AB The Seychelles is a small island state in the western Indian Ocean that
   is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This vulnerability led
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 to express
   concern over the potential economic and social consequences that may be
   faced by small island states. Small island states should be prepared to
   adapt to such changes, especially in view of their dependence on natural
   resources, such as water and coral reefs, to meet basic human welfare
   needs. Analysis of long-term data for precipitation, air temperature,
   and sea-surface temperature indicated that changes are already
   observable in the Seychelles. The increase in dry spells that resulted
   in drought conditions in 1999 and the 1998 mass coral bleaching are
   indicative of the events that are likely to occur under future climate
   change. Pre-IPCC Third Assessment Report scenarios and the new SRES
   scenarios are compared for changes in precipitation and air surface
   temperature for the Seychelles. These intercomparisons indicate that the
   IS92 scenarios project a much warmer and wetter climate for the
   Seychelles than do the SRES scenarios. However, a wetter climate does
   not imply readily available water, but rather longer dry spells with
   more intense precipitation events. These observations will likely place
   enormous pressures on water-resources management in the Seychelles.
   Similarly, sea-surface temperature increases predicted by the HADCM3
   model will likely trigger repeated coral-bleaching episodes, with
   possible coral extinctions within the Seychelles region by 2040. The
   cover of many coral reefs around the Seychelles have already changed,
   and the protection of coral-resilient areas is a critical adaptive
   option.

AB Since the mid-nineteenth century the Earth's surface has warmed(1-3),
   and models indicate that human activities have caused part of the
   warming by altering the radiative balance of the atmosphere(1,3). Simple
   theories suggest that global warming will reduce the strength of the
   mean tropical atmospheric circulation(4,5). An important aspect of this
   tropical circulation is a large-scale zonal (east-west) overturning of
   air across the equatorial Pacific Ocean-driven by convection to the west
   and subsidence to the east-known as the Walker circulation(6). Here we
   explore changes in tropical Pacific circulation since the mid-nineteenth
   century using observations and a suite of global climate model
   experiments. Observed Indo-Pacific sea level pressure reveals a
   weakening of the Walker circulation. The size of this trend is
   consistent with theoretical predictions, is accurately reproduced by
   climate model simulations and, within the climate models, is largely due
   to anthropogenic forcing. The climate model indicates that the weakened
   surface winds have altered the thermal structure and circulation of the
   tropical Pacific Ocean. These results support model projections of
   further weakening of tropical atmospheric circulation during the
   twenty-first century(4,5,7).

AB Climate variability and global change studies are increasingly focused
   on understanding and predicting regional changes of daily weather
   statistics. Assessing the evidence for such variations over the last 100
   yr requires a daily tropospheric circulation dataset. The only dataset
   available for the early twentieth century consists of error-ridden
   hand-drawn analyses of the mean sea level pressure field over the
   Northern Hemisphere. Modern data assimilation systems have the potential
   to improve upon these maps, but prior to 1948, few digitized upper-air
   sounding observations are available for such a "reanalysis." We
   investigate the possibility that the additional number of newly
   recovered surface pressure observations is sufficient to generate useful
   weather maps of the lower-tropospheric extratropical circulation back to
   1890 over the Northern Hemisphere, and back to 1930 over the Southern
   Hemisphere. Surprisingly, we find that by using an advanced data
   assimilation system based on an ensemble Kalman filter, it would be
   feasible to produce high-quality maps of even the upper troposphere
   using only surface pressure observations. For the beginning of the
   twentieth century, the errors of such upper-air circulation maps over
   the Northern Hemisphere in winter would be comparable to the 2-3-day
   errors of modern weather forecasts.

AB A new flexible gridded dataset of sea surface temperature (SST) since
   1850 is presented and its uncertainties are quantified. This analysis
   [the Second Hadley Centre Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadSST2)] is
   based on data contained within the recently created International
   Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) database and so is
   superior in geographical coverage to previous datasets and has smaller
   uncertainties. Issues arising when analyzing a database of observations
   measured from very different platforms and drawn from many different
   countries with different measurement practices are introduced. Improved
   bias corrections are applied to the data to account for changes in
   measurement conditions through time. A detailed analysis of
   uncertainties in these corrections is included by exploring assumptions
   made in their construction and producing multiple versions using a Monte
   Carlo method. An assessment of total uncertainty in each gridded average
   is obtained by combining these bias-correctionrelated uncertainties with
   those arising from measurement errors and undersampling of intragrid box
   variability. These are calculated by partitioning the variance in grid
   box averages between real and spurious variability. From month to month
   in individual grid boxes, sampling uncertainties tend to be most
   important (except in certain regions), but on large-scale averages
   bias-correction uncertainties are more dominant owing to their
   correlation between grid boxes. Changes in large-scale SST through time
   are assessed by two methods. The linear warming between 1.850 and 2004
   was 0.52 degrees +/- 0.19 degrees C (95% confidence interval) for the
   globe, 0.59 degrees +/- 0.20 degrees C for the Northern Hemisphere, and
   0.46 degrees +/- 0.29 degrees C for the Southern Hemisphere. Decadally
   filtered differences for these regions over this period were 0.67
   degrees +/- 0.04 degrees C, 0.71 degrees +/- 0.06 degrees C, and 0.64
   degrees +/- 0.07 degrees C.

   ships' logbooks during the recently finished CLIWOC project have been
   used to produce the first gridded Sea Level Pressure ( SLP)
   reconstruction for the 1750 - 1850 period over the North Atlantic based
   solely on marine data. The reconstruction is based on a spatial
   regression analysis calibrated by using data taken from the ICOADS
   database. An objective methodology has been developed to select the
   optimal calibration period and spatial domain of the reconstruction by
   testing several thousands of possible models. The finally selected area,
   limited by the performance of the regression equations and by the
   availability of data, covers the region between 28 degrees N and 52
   degrees N close to the European coast and between 28 degrees N and 44
   degrees N in the open Ocean. The results provide a direct measure of the
   strength and extension of the Azores High during the 101 years of the
   study period. The comparison with the recent land-based SLP
   reconstruction by Luterbacher et al. ( 2002) indicates the presence of a
   common signal. The interannual variability of the CLIWOC reconstructions
   is rather high due to the current scarcity of abstracted wind data in
   the areas with best response in the regression. Guidelines are proposed
   to optimize the efficiency of future abstraction work.
